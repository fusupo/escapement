(check \"depends on\" mentions)\n   - Will this block other work? (check \"blocks\" mentions)\n   - Are there API contract implications?\n   - Check milestone dependencies\n\n### Phase 3: Create Scratchpad\n\n**Generate:** `SCRATCHPAD_{issue_number}.md`\n\n**Template Structure:**\n\n```markdown\n# {Issue Title} - #{issue_number}\n\n## Issue Details\n- **Repository:** {owner/repo}\n- **GitHub URL:** {issue_url}\n- **State:** {open/closed}\n- **Labels:** {labels}\n- **Milestone:** {milestone if exists}\n- **Assignees:** {assignees}\n- **Related Issues:** {linked issues if any}\n  - Depends on: #{issue_numbers}\n  - Blocks: #{issue_numbers}\n  - Related: #{issue_numbers}\n\n## Description\n{full issue body from GitHub}\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n{extract task list from issue body, or create from description}\n- [ ] {criterion 1}\n- [ ] {criterion 2}\n- [ ] {criterion 3}\n\n## Branch Strategy\n- **Base branch:** main (or develop-ts/develop if exists)\n- **Feature branch:** {issue_number}-{slugified-title}\n- **Current branch:** {git branch --show-current}\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\n### Setup\n- [ ] Fetch latest from base branch\n- [ ] Create and checkout feature branch\n\n### Implementation Tasks\n{Break down into atomic commits - each should be independently reviewable}\n\n- [ ] {First atomic task with clear scope}\n  - Files affected: {list}\n  - Why: {brief rationale}\n  \n- [ ] {Second atomic task}\n  - Files affected: {list}\n  - Why: {brief rationale}\n\n{Continue with granular breakdown...}\n\n### Quality Checks\n- [ ] Run linter/type checker\n- [ ] Execute relevant tests\n- [ ] Self-review for code quality\n- [ ] Verify acceptance criteria met\n\n### Documentation\n- [ ] Update relevant README/docs (if applicable)\n- [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic (if applicable)\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n{Any architectural decisions to consider}\n{Module boundaries to respect}\n{Integration points to handle}\n\n### Implementation Approach\n{High-level strategy for solving the problem}\n{Why this approach vs alternatives}\n\n### Potential Challenges\n{Known complexity areas}\n{Technical debt to navigate}\n{Performance considerations}\n\n## Questions/Blockers\n\n### Clarifications Needed\n{List any unclear requirements}\n{Ambiguities in issue description}\n\n### Blocked By\n{List any dependencies not yet complete - reference issue numbers}\n\n### Assumptions Made\n{Document assumptions if requirements unclear}\n\n### Decisions Made\n{Populated during Phase 3.5 Interactive Q&A}\n{Format: Q: question → A: decision (rationale)}\n\n## Work Log\n\n{This section fills in during execution via /start-work}\n{Each work session adds dated entries}\n\n---\n**Generated:** {timestamp}\n**By:** Issue Setup Skill\n**Source:** {github_issue_url}\n```\n\n**Scratchpad Quality Guidelines:**\n\n- **Atomic tasks:** Each checklist item should be one commit\n- **Clear scope:** Reader should understand what each task does\n- **Testable:** Acceptance criteria should be verifiable\n- **Realistic:** Don't over-engineer or under-scope\n- **Contextual:** Reference project-specific conventions\n\n### Phase 3.5: Interactive Q&A (Resolve Clarifications)\n\n**Goal:** Resolve any questions or ambiguities before starting implementation.\n\n**Trigger:** If the scratchpad has items in the \"Clarifications Needed\" section.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Check for Outstanding Questions:**\n   - Review the Questions/Blockers section of the scratchpad\n   - If \"Clarifications Needed\" is empty, skip to Phase 4\n   - If questions exist, proceed with interactive resolution\n\n2. **Present Questions via AskUserQuestion:**\n   For each clarification needed, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to get user input:\n\n   ```\n   AskUserQuestion:\n     question: \"{The specific clarification question}\"\n     header: \"Clarify\"\n     options:\n       - label: \"{Option A}\"\n         description: \"{What this choice means}\"\n       - label: \"{Option B}\"\n         description: \"{What this choice means}\"\n       - label: \"{Option C}\" (if applicable)\n         description: \"{What this choice means}\"\n     multiSelect: false (or true if multiple answers valid)\n   ```\n\n   **Guidelines for presenting questions:**\n   - Frame questions clearly with context\n   - Provide 2-4 concrete options when possible\n   - Include descriptions explaining implications of each choice\n   - User can always select \"Other\" for custom input\n   - Group related questions if they have dependencies\n\n3. **Update Scratchpad with Decisions:**\n   After collecting all answers, update the scratchpad:\n\n   a) **Add \"Decisions Made\" section** (if not present) under Questions/Blockers:\n   ```markdown\n   ### Decisions Made\n   {Timestamp}\n\n   **Q: {Original question}**\n   **A:** {User's answer/decision}\n   **Rationale:** {Brief explanation of why, if provided}\n   ```\n\n   b) **Remove resolved items** from \"Clarifications Needed\"\n\n   c) **Update relevant sections** if decisions affect:\n      - Implementation tasks (add/remove/modify based on decisions)\n      - Technical approach\n      - Assumptions (convert to confirmed decisions)\n\n4. **Confirm Resolution:**\n   Display summary of decisions made:\n   ```\n   ✓ Resolved {N} clarifications:\n\n   1. {Question summary} → {Decision}\n   2. {Question summary} → {Decision}\n   ...\n\n   📋 SCRATCHPAD updated with decisions.\n   ```\n\n**Example Interaction:**\n\n```\n📋 SCRATCHPAD_42.md has 3 clarifications that need resolution before proceeding.\n\n[AskUserQuestion 1/3]\nQuestion: \"Should we keep commands as aliases during the transition to skills?\"\nHeader: \"Migration\"\nOptions:\n  - \"Keep as thin wrappers\" - Commands remain but delegate to skills\n  - \"Remove immediately\" - Clean break, skills only\n  - \"Decide per-command\" - Evaluate each command individually\n\n[User selects: \"Keep as thin wrappers\"]\n\n[AskUserQuestion 2/3]\nQuestion: \"How should prime-session be handled?\"\nHeader: \"Behavior\"\nOptions:\n  - \"Convert to auto-invoke skill\" - Activates when entering new repo\n  - \"Keep as explicit command\" - User must invoke manually\n  - \"Remove entirely\" - Claude reads CLAUDE.md automatically anyway\n\n[User selects: \"Keep as explicit command\"]\n\n...\n\n✓ Resolved 3 clarifications:\n\n1. Migration strategy → Keep commands as thin wrappers\n2. prime-session behavior → Keep as explicit command\n3. ...\n\n📋 SCRATCHPAD_42.md updated with decisions.\nProceeding to branch creation...\n```\n\n**Skip Conditions:**\n- No items in \"Clarifications Needed\" → Skip directly to Phase 4\n- User explicitly requests to skip → Note unresolved questions, proceed with assumptions\n\n### Phase 4: Prepare Workspace\n\n**Branch Creation:**\n\n1. **Detect base branch:**\n   ```bash\n   # Check what branches exist\n   git fetch origin\n   \n   # Prefer in this order:\n   # 1. develop-ts (if exists)\n   # 2. develop (if exists)\n   # 3. main (default)\n   git branch -r | grep -E 'origin/(develop-ts|develop|main)'\n   ```\n\n2. **Create feature branch:**\n   ```bash\n   # Generate branch name from issue\n   # Format: {issue_number}-{slugified-title}\n   # Example: 42-implement-fact-batching\n   \n   git branch {issue-number}-{slugified-title} origin/{base-branch}\n   # Don't checkout yet - let operator decide when to switch\n   ```\n\n3. **Confirm creation:**\n   ```bash\n   git branch --list {branch-name}\n   ```\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nDisplay concise summary:\n```\n✓ Issue #{issue_number} analyzed and prepared\n\n📋 SCRATCHPAD_{issue_number}.md created with:\n   - {X} implementation tasks\n   - {Y} quality checks\n   - {Z} decisions made (via Q&A)\n\n🌿 Branch '{issue-number}-{slugified-title}' created from {base-branch}\n\n🔗 GitHub Issue: {issue_url}\n\n🚀 Ready to begin work:\n   git checkout {branch-name}\n   # Then start implementation\n```\n\n**Note:** If clarifications were resolved in Phase 3.5, the scratchpad now contains\nconfirmed decisions rather than open questions. All ambiguities should be resolved\nbefore reaching this point.\n\n## Project-Specific Adaptations\n\n### For UI/Frontend Projects:\n\n**Component Context:**\n- Which components affected?\n- State management implications?\n- API contract dependencies?\n\n### For API/Backend Projects:\n\n**Contract Context:**\n- API endpoints added/modified?\n- Breaking changes?\n- Database migrations needed?\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Issue Not Found\nIf GitHub issue doesn't exist:\n- Verify issue number and repository\n- Check if issue is in different repo\n- Offer to search issues by title/keyword\n- Confirm you have access to private repos (if applicable)\n\n### Insufficient Information\nIf issue lacks description or clear scope:\n- Note this prominently in Questions/Blockers\n- Suggest adding task list to issue before starting work\n- Don't guess - make assumptions explicit\n- Consider commenting on issue to request clarification\n\n### Branch Already Exists\nIf feature branch already exists:\n- Check if work in progress (git log)\n- Offer to resume vs. create new branch\n- Warn about potential conflicts\n- Suggest reviewing existing commits\n\n### Repository Access Issues\nIf can't access repository:\n- Verify GitHub authentication (gh auth status)\n- Check repository exists (might be private)\n- Confirm repository name spelling\n- Ensure gh CLI is installed and configured\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Flows to:**\n- `/start-work {issue_number}` - Begin execution from scratchpad\n- `/commit` - Make atomic commits as checklist progresses\n\n**Receives context from:**\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Architecture and conventions\n- `/prime-session` - Current development priorities\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Read acceptance criteria carefully\n- Break work into truly atomic commits\n- Flag ambiguities early\n- Research codebase before planning\n- Make scratchpad detailed but scannable\n- Document assumptions explicitly\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Start coding before scratchpad approved\n- Guess at unclear requirements\n- Create tasks too large to review\n- Skip codebase investigation\n- Over-engineer the plan\n- Hide complexity in vague task descriptions\n\n## Operator Interaction Points\n\n**Before Scratchpad Creation:**\nIf issue is complex or ambiguous, ask:\n- \"This issue affects multiple modules. Should we break it into sub-issues?\"\n- \"Acceptance criteria unclear on X. Should we clarify before planning?\"\n\n**After Scratchpad Created:**\nPresent for review:\n- \"I've created SCRATCHPAD_42.md. Please review the implementation plan.\"\n- \"I flagged 2 questions in the Blockers section - need clarification?\"\n\n**Before Branch Creation:**\nConfirm readiness:\n- \"Base branch develop-ts is 5 commits behind origin. Pull first?\"\n- \"Ready to create feature branch?\"\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nA successful issue setup produces:\n\n✓ **Complete context:** All issue details captured\n✓ **Clear plan:** Implementation steps are atomic and logical\n✓ **Identified risks:** Challenges flagged upfront\n✓ **Ready workspace:** Branch created, scratchpad prepared\n✓ **Operator confidence:** Developer knows exactly what to build\n\nThe scratchpad should be so clear that another developer could pick it up and execute it.\n\n### Complex Implementation Detection\n\nIf the issue analysis reveals a complex implementation, suggest entering plan mode:\n\n**Triggers for EnterPlanMode:**\n- Implementation affects more than 3-4 files\n- Multiple valid architectural approaches exist\n- Significant refactoring required\n- New patterns or abstractions needed\n- Breaking changes to existing APIs\n\n**Suggestion:**\n```\nThis issue appears complex ({reason}). Would you like me to enter\nplan mode to design the implementation approach before we proceed?\n```\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.1.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-31\n**Maintained By:** Escapement\n**Changelog:**\n- v1.1.0: Added Task delegation to Explore agent, parallel execution, LSP integration, EnterPlanMode triggers\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 19"

✓ Issue #19 analyzed and prepared

📋 **SCRATCHPAD_19.md** created with:
   - 2 directory renames (issue-setup → setup-work, work-session → do-work)
   - 6 implementation task groups (directories, frontmatter, docs updates, cross-references, quality checks, testing)
   - Clear atomic commit strategy
   - Comprehensive file inventory

🌿 **Branch '19-standardize-skill-naming'** created from main

🔗 **GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/fusupo/escapement/issues/19

**Key Changes:**
- `issue-setup` → `setup-work` (broader scope, consistent pattern)
- `work-session` → `do-work` (natural English, action-oriented)
- All other skills already follow verb-noun pattern

**Breaking Changes:**
- Explicit invocations change: `/escapement:issue-setup` → `/escapement:setup-work`
- Explicit invocations change: `/escapement:work-session` → `/escapement:do-work`
- Natural language triggers will be updated to handle new names

🚀 **Ready to begin work:**
```bash
git checkout 19-standardize-skill-naming
# Then start implementation
```

This is a well-scoped refactoring to establish consistent naming conventions across all skills. The scratchpad breaks down the work into 6 atomic commit groups covering directory renames, frontmatter updates, documentation updates, and comprehensive testing.

### 👤 User

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **User's Initial Request**: The user invoked a skill with the command "setup issue 19" - this is a request to use the escapement plugin's issue-setup skill to prepare issue #19 for development work.

2. **Skill Execution Context**: The system provided the skill documentation for "issue-setup" which defines a comprehensive workflow for transforming a GitHub issue into a development environment with scratchpad, feature branch, and context.

3. **My Approach**: I followed the issue-setup skill workflow:
   - Phase 0: Checked for existing scratchpad (none found)
   - Phase 1: Gathered context in parallel:
     - Checked git status and current branch (main)
     - Retrieved GitHub issue #19 details
     - Retrieved issue comments (none)
     - Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
   - Phase 2: Analyzed the issue requirements
   - Phase 3: Created comprehensive scratchpad
   - Phase 4: Created feature branch

4. **Key Technical Details**:
   - Repository: fusupo/escapement
   - Issue #19: "Standardize skill naming convention to consistent verb-noun pattern"
   - Current branch: main
   - Feature branch created: 19-standardize-skill-naming
   - No scratchpad existed prior to this work

5. **Issue Content**: The issue proposes renaming two skills:
   - `issue-setup` → `setup-work`
   - `work-session` → `do-work`
   - All other skills already follow verb-noun pattern

6. **Files Created/Modified**:
   - Created: SCRATCHPAD_19.md with comprehensive implementation plan
   - Branch created: 19-standardize-skill-naming

7. **No Errors Encountered**: The workflow executed smoothly without any errors.

8. **Current State**: The setup is complete. The scratchpad has been created with 6 major task groups, and the feature branch is ready. The user has NOT yet checked out the branch or started implementation.

9. **User Messages**: Only one substantive user message: "setup issue 19"

10. **Pending Tasks**: The implementation tasks are all outlined in the scratchpad but NOT yet started. The setup phase is complete.

Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent**:
   The user requested to set up issue #19 for development work by invoking the command "setup issue 19". This triggered the escapement plugin's issue-setup skill, which is designed to transform a GitHub issue into a fully-prepared development environment including issue context analysis, scratchpad creation, and feature branch preparation.

2. **Key Technical Concepts**:
   - Escapement plugin architecture (Claude Code plugin system)
   - Skill-based workflow automation
   - GitHub issue integration via MCP tools
   - Scratchpad-driven development methodology
   - Git feature branch workflow
   - Verb-noun naming convention pattern for skills
   - Breaking changes in skill naming (explicit invocations)
   - Plugin manifest and frontmatter configuration

3. **Files and Code Sections**:

   - **SCRATCHPAD_19.md** (Created)
     - Why: Central implementation plan and progress tracking document for issue #19
     - Contains: Complete issue details, acceptance criteria, implementation checklist broken into 8 task groups (Setup, Rename Directories, Update Frontmatter, Update CLAUDE.md, Update README.md, Update docs/, Update Cross-References, Quality Checks, Testing)
     - Key sections include:
       ```markdown
       ## Branch Strategy
       - **Base branch:** main
       - **Feature branch:** 19-standardize-skill-naming
       - **Current branch:** main
       
       ### 1. Rename Skill Directories
       - [ ] Rename `skills/issue-setup/` → `skills/setup-work/`
       - [ ] Rename `skills/work-session/` → `skills/do-work/`
       
       ### 2. Update Skill Frontmatter
       - [ ] Update `skills/setup-work/SKILL.md` - Change `name:` field to `setup-work`
       - [ ] Update `skills/do-work/SKILL.md` - Change `name:` field to `do-work`
       ```

   - **CLAUDE.md** (Read)
     - Why: Project documentation that defines plugin architecture, skill structure, and development conventions
     - Key content: Lists current skills directory structure showing `skills/issue-setup/` and `skills/work-session/` that need renaming
     - Skills table at lines 54-62 showing trigger examples for each skill
     - Important note about scratchpad creation by issue-setup skill (line ~128)

   - **GitHub Issue #19** (Retrieved)
     - Repository: fusupo/escapement
     - Title: "Standardize skill naming convention to consistent verb-noun pattern"
     - Proposes renaming: `issue-setup` → `setup-work`, `work-session` → `do-work`
     - Contains implementation tasks checklist and acceptance criteria
     - Notes this is a breaking change for explicit skill invocations

   - **Git Branch 19-standardize-skill-naming** (Created)
     - Created from origin/main
     - Command used: `git branch 19-standardize-skill-naming origin/main`
     - Status: Branch created but not checked out (current branch still main)

4. **Errors and Fixes**:
   No errors were encountered during this workflow. The issue setup process executed successfully without any problems.

5. **Problem Solving**:
   - **Solved**: Determined the appropriate base branch (main) by checking available remote branches
   - **Solved**: Generated appropriate branch name following convention: `{issue-number}-{slugified-title}` = `19-standardize-skill-naming`
   - **Solved**: Created comprehensive implementation plan breaking work into atomic, committable tasks across 6 major groups
   - **Identified**: This is a breaking change that will affect users using explicit skill invocations (`/escapement:issue-setup` and `/escapement:work-session`)
   - **Documented**: Assumption that archived work in `docs/dev/cc-archive/` does NOT need updating (historical record)

6. **All User Messages**:
   - "setup issue 19" - Initial request to set up issue #19 for development

7. **Pending Tasks**:
   All implementation tasks are documented in SCRATCHPAD_19.md but NOT yet started:
   - Rename `skills/issue-setup/` → `skills/setup-work/`
   - Rename `skills/work-session/` → `skills/do-work/`
   - Update skill frontmatter name fields
   - Update CLAUDE.md references (directory structure, skills table, scratchpad convention)
   - Update README.md references (skills table, workflow examples)
   - Update docs/WORKFLOW.md and docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md
   - Search and replace skill cross-references in all skill files
   - Quality checks and comprehensive testing

8. **Current Work**:
   The issue setup skill execution has been **completed successfully**. The final actions were:
   
   - Created comprehensive SCRATCHPAD_19.md file with implementation plan
   - Created feature branch `19-standardize-skill-naming` from origin/main
   - Displayed summary output to user:
   
   ```
   ✓ Issue #19 analyzed and prepared
   
   📋 SCRATCHPAD_19.md created with:
      - 2 directory renames (issue-setup → setup-work, work-session → do-work)
      - 6 implementation task groups
      - Clear atomic commit strategy
      - Comprehensive file inventory
   
   🌿 Branch '19-standardize-skill-naming' created from main
   
   🔗 GitHub Issue: https://github.com/fusupo/escapement/issues/19
   
   🚀 Ready to begin work:
   git checkout 19-standardize-skill-naming
   # Then start implementation
   ```
   
   The user is currently on the main branch and has not yet checked out the feature branch to begin implementation work.

9. **Optional Next Step**:
   The issue setup phase is complete. Based on the escapement workflow, the logical next step would be for the user to check out the feature branch and begin implementation, potentially by invoking a work-session skill. However, the user has not explicitly requested to proceed with implementation. The setup task as requested ("setup issue 19") has been fully completed.
   
   From the final output: "🚀 Ready to begin work: git checkout 19-standardize-skill-naming"
   
   No next step should be taken without explicit user direction, as the requested task (issue setup) is complete..

This skill loads the implementation plan, creates TodoWrite items for visibility, works through tasks systematically, and coordinates commits after task completion.\n\n## Natural Language Triggers\n\nThis skill activates when the user says things like:\n- \"Start work on issue #42\" (default trigger)\n- \"Do work on issue #42\"\n- \"Work on issue #42\"\n- \"Continue work on this issue\"\n- \"Resume work\"\n- \"Keep working\"\n- \"Let's work through the scratchpad\"\n- \"Work on the next task\"\n- \"Pick up where we left off\"\n\n## Workflow Execution\n\n### Phase 0: Check Scratchpad Exists (Self-Correction)\n\n**Before proceeding with work, verify scratchpad exists:**\n\n1. **Detect Scratchpad:**\n   - Look for `SCRATCHPAD_{issue_number}.md` in project root\n   - If issue number provided, look for specific scratchpad\n\n2. **If scratchpad NOT found:**\n   ```\n   ❌ No scratchpad found for issue #{number}\n\n   Would you like to run issue-setup first?\n   ```\n\n   Use AskUserQuestion:\n   ```\n   AskUserQuestion:\n     questions:\n       - question: \"No scratchpad found. Run issue-setup to initialize?\"\n         header: \"Setup Required\"\n         multiSelect: false\n         options:\n           - label: \"Yes, run issue-setup\"\n             description: \"Create scratchpad and branch for this issue\"\n           - label: \"No, create manually\"\n             description: \"I'll set up the scratchpad myself\"\n   ```\n\n   If user chooses \"Yes\":\n   ```\n   Skill: issue-setup\n   args: \"{issue_number}\"\n   ```\n\n   **STOP here** - issue-setup will create scratchpad and can chain to work-session after.\n\n3. **If scratchpad exists:**\n   - Proceed to Phase 1 (normal work flow)\n\n### Phase 1: Validate Setup\n\n1. **Load Scratchpad:**\n   - Scratchpad confirmed to exist from Phase 0\n   - Read full scratchpad content\n   - Parse implementation checklist\n   - Identify completed vs pending tasks\n\n2. **Verify Branch:**\n   - Check current branch matches expected feature branch\n   - If not, offer to switch:\n     ```\n     AskUserQuestion:\n       question: \"Switch to feature branch {branch-name}?\"\n       options:\n         - \"Yes, switch branches\"\n         - \"No, stay on current branch\"\n     ```\n\n4. **Resume Detection:**\n   - Check Work Log for previous session\n   - Identify last task in progress\n   - Offer to resume or start fresh\n\n### Phase 2: Initialize TodoWrite\n\nCreate TodoWrite items from scratchpad checklist:\n\n```\nTodoWrite:\n  todos:\n    - content: \"{Task 1 description}\"\n      status: \"completed\"  # if already done\n      activeForm: \"{Task 1 active description}\"\n    - content: \"{Task 2 description}\"\n      status: \"in_progress\"  # current task\n      activeForm: \"{Task 2 active description}\"\n    - content: \"{Task 3 description}\"\n      status: \"pending\"\n      activeForm: \"{Task 3 active description}\"\n    ...\n```\n\n**Sync Strategy:**\n- TodoWrite = Live UI progress (transient, session-based)\n- Scratchpad = Persistent record with notes (survives sessions)\n- Keep both in sync: when TodoWrite updates, update scratchpad checkboxes\n\n### Phase 3: Work Loop\n\nFor each unchecked item in the Implementation Checklist:\n\n#### 3.1 Start Task\n\n1. **Update TodoWrite:**\n   - Mark current task as `in_progress`\n   - All others remain `pending` or `completed`\n\n2. **Display Task:**\n   ```\n   📍 Working on: {task description}\n      Files: {affected files}\n      Why: {rationale}\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Scratchpad Work Log:**\n   ```markdown\n   ### {Date} - Session Start\n   - Starting: {task description}\n   ```\n\n#### 3.2 Implement Task\n\n**Before starting implementation, assess complexity:**\n\n**Complex Task Detection → EnterPlanMode:**\nIf the task involves:\n- Changes to more than 3-4 files\n- Multiple valid implementation approaches\n- New patterns or architectural decisions\n- Significant refactoring\n\nThen suggest entering plan mode:\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"This task appears complex ({reason}). Enter plan mode first?\"\n  header: \"Approach\"\n  options:\n    - \"Yes, plan first\"\n      description: \"Enter plan mode to design approach before implementing\"\n    - \"No, proceed directly\"\n      description: \"Start implementing without formal planning\"\n```\n\nIf user chooses to plan, use `EnterPlanMode` tool.\n\n**Delegate Complex Subtasks → Task Tool:**\nFor complex analysis or exploration during implementation:\n```\nTask:\n  subagent_type: Explore\n  prompt: \"Find all usages of {pattern} and how they integrate with {module}\"\n  description: \"Explore {area} for implementation\"\n```\n\n**Execute the actual work:**\n- Use LSP for code navigation (goToDefinition, findReferences, documentSymbol)\n- Create/modify files as needed\n- Run relevant commands\n- Test changes locally\n\n#### 3.3 Complete Task\n\n1. **Update TodoWrite:**\n   - Mark task as `completed`\n   - Move to next task\n\n2. **Update Scratchpad:**\n   - Check off completed item: `- [x] {task}`\n   - Add notes to Work Log:\n     ```markdown\n     - Completed: {task description}\n       - Notes: {any decisions or observations}\n     ```\n\n3. **Offer Commit:**\n   ```\n   AskUserQuestion:\n     question: \"Task complete. Ready to commit?\"\n     header: \"Commit\"\n     options:\n       - \"Yes, commit now\"\n         description: \"Invoke commit-changes skill for this task\"\n       - \"Continue to next task\"\n         description: \"Skip commit, keep working\"\n       - \"Review changes first\"\n         description: \"Show me what changed before committing\"\n   ```\n\n4. **If committing:** Invoke `commit-changes` skill\n   ```\n   Skill: commit-changes\n   ```\n\n5. **Progress Update:**\n   ```\n   ✓ {X} of {Y} tasks complete\n   ```\n\n#### 3.4 Handle Blockers\n\nIf blocked during a task:\n\n1. **Update Scratchpad:**\n   - Add to Questions/Blockers section\n   - Note what's blocking progress\n\n2. **Ask User:**\n   ```\n   AskUserQuestion:\n     question: \"Encountered blocker: {description}. How to proceed?\"\n     options:\n       - \"Help me resolve it\"\n       - \"Skip to next task\"\n       - \"Pause work session\"\n       - \"Add to blockers and continue\"\n   ```\n\n### Phase 4: Continuous Sync\n\nThroughout the session:\n\n1. **Push Reminders:**\n   - After every 2-3 commits, offer to push:\n     ```\n     📤 You have {N} unpushed commits. Push to remote?\n     ```\n\n2. **Progress Persistence:**\n   - Keep scratchpad updated with running notes\n   - Work Log captures decisions made\n   - Checklist reflects completion state\n\n3. **Interruption Handling:**\n   - If work is interrupted, save state:\n     - Note current task in Work Log\n     - Save any uncommitted progress notes\n     - Can resume later with same skill\n\n### Phase 5: Completion Check\n\nWhen all Implementation Tasks are complete:\n\n1. **Quality Checks:**\n   - Run through Quality Checks section of scratchpad\n   - Execute linters/tests as applicable\n   - Self-review for code quality\n\n2. **Verify Acceptance Criteria:**\n   - Review original acceptance criteria\n   - Confirm all are met\n\n3. **Update Scratchpad:**\n   ```markdown\n   ### {Date} - Session Complete\n   - All implementation tasks complete\n   - Quality checks: {passed/issues}\n   - Ready for PR: {yes/no}\n   ```\n\n4. **Final TodoWrite:**\n   - All tasks marked `completed`\n   - Clear visual confirmation of completion\n\n### Phase 6: Next Steps\n\nPresent options:\n\n```\n✅ All tasks complete!\n\nOptions:\n1. Create PR → Invoke create-pr skill\n2. Archive scratchpad → Invoke archive-work skill\n3. Continue in session → Keep working (add more tasks?)\n4. End session → Save state and exit\n\nSelect option:\n```\n\n## State Management\n\n### TodoWrite ↔ Scratchpad Sync\n\n| Action | TodoWrite | Scratchpad |\n|--------|-----------|------------|\n| Task starts | `in_progress` | Work Log entry |\n| Task completes | `completed` | Checkbox checked, Work Log note |\n| Task blocked | stays `in_progress` | Blockers section updated |\n| Session ends | cleared | Work Log \"session end\" |\n| Session resumes | rebuilt from scratchpad | Work Log \"session resume\" |\n\n### Progress Recovery\n\nIf Claude Code restarts mid-session:\n1. Re-read scratchpad\n2. Rebuild TodoWrite from checklist state\n3. Resume from last incomplete task\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Scratchpad Not Found\n```\n❌ No scratchpad found for issue #{number}\n\n   Would you like to:\n   1. Run issue-setup for this issue\n   2. Specify a different issue number\n   3. Create a new scratchpad manually\n```\n\n### Wrong Branch\n```\n⚠️ Expected branch: {expected}\n   Current branch: {current}\n\n   Would you like to switch branches?\n```\n\n### Uncommitted Changes from Previous Session\n```\n⚠️ Found uncommitted changes from previous work.\n\n   Options:\n   1. Commit these changes now\n   2. Stash and continue\n   3. Review changes first\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Invokes:**\n- `commit-changes` skill - After completing tasks\n- `create-pr` skill - When all tasks complete\n- `archive-work` skill - After PR created\n\n**Invoked by:**\n- User directly via natural language\n- After `issue-setup` skill completes\n\n**Reads from:**\n- Scratchpad - Implementation plan\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Conventions\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Keep TodoWrite in sync with scratchpad\n- Add notes to Work Log for decisions\n- Commit after each logical task\n- Update blockers promptly\n- Review progress periodically\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Skip TodoWrite updates\n- Let scratchpad get stale\n- Batch too many changes before committing\n- Ignore blockers\n- Leave session without saving state\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.1.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-31\n**Maintained By:** Escapement\n**Changelog:**\n- v1.1.0: Added EnterPlanMode for complex tasks, Task delegation, LSP navigation\n- v1.0.0: Initial conversion from commands/start-work.md\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 19"

This skill analyzes changes, crafts meaningful commit messages, and ensures commits are atomic and purposeful.\n\n## Natural Language Triggers\n\nThis skill activates when the user says things like:\n- \"Commit these changes\"\n- \"Create a commit\"\n- \"Commit this\"\n- \"Save my changes\"\n- \"Make a commit for this work\"\n- After completing a scratchpad task: \"Done with this task, commit it\"\n\n## Workflow Execution\n\n### Phase 1: Gather Context (Parallel)\n\nExecute these in parallel for efficiency:\n\n1. **Project Context:**\n   - Read project's `CLAUDE.md` for module emojis and conventions\n   - Identify current development phase/priorities\n\n2. **Git Context:**\n   - `git status` - See staged/unstaged changes\n   - `git diff --cached` - Review staged changes (if any)\n   - `git diff` - Review unstaged changes\n   - `git branch --show-current` - Current branch\n   - `git log --oneline -5` - Recent commits for style reference\n\n### Phase 2: Analyze Changes\n\n1. **Categorize Changes:**\n   - Which files are modified/added/deleted?\n   - Which module(s) are affected?\n   - What type of change is this? (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)\n\n2. **Staging Decision:**\n   - If nothing staged but changes exist: Determine what should be staged together\n   - Group logically related changes\n   - Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit\n   - If multiple logical changes exist, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which to commit first\n\n3. **Validate Commit-Worthiness:**\n   - Ensure changes represent one logical unit of work\n   - Check for debugging code, console.logs, temp files\n   - Verify no secrets or sensitive data included\n\n### Phase 3: Craft Commit Message\n\n**Format:**\n```\n{module emoji}{change type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n{optional body explaining what and why}\n```\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Module Emoji:** From project's CLAUDE.md\n   - Check `## Project Modules` section for project-specific emojis\n   - Default examples: 🌐 api, 🎨 frontend, 🗄️ database, 🔐 auth, 📚 docs\n   - Use the most specific module that applies\n\n2. **Change Type Emoji:**\n   - ✨ feat: New feature\n   - 🐛 fix: Bug fix\n   - 📝 docs: Documentation\n   - 💄 style: Formatting/style\n   - ♻️ refactor: Code refactoring\n   - ⚡️ perf: Performance improvements\n   - ✅ test: Tests\n   - 🔧 chore: Tooling, configuration\n   - 🚀 ci: CI/CD improvements\n   - 🔥 fix: Remove code or files\n   - 🎨 style: Improve structure/format\n   - 🚑️ fix: Critical hotfix\n   - 🎉 chore: Begin a project\n   - 🏗️ refactor: Architectural changes\n   - 🏷️ feat: Add or update types\n   - ⚰️ refactor: Remove dead code\n\n3. **Type:** Conventional commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci)\n\n4. **Scope:** Module name from CLAUDE.md (e.g., api, frontend, skills)\n\n5. **Description:**\n   - Imperative mood (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n   - No period at end\n   - Under 50 characters\n   - Focus on capability/value added\n\n6. **Body (optional):**\n   - Explain what and why, not how\n   - Context for the change\n   - Reference issue numbers if applicable\n\n### Phase 4: Confirm with User\n\nUse `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the commit:\n\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"Ready to commit with this message?\"\n  header: \"Commit\"\n  options:\n    - label: \"Yes, commit\"\n      description: \"Create the commit with this message\"\n    - label: \"Edit message\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the commit message\"\n    - label: \"Stage more files\"\n      description: \"I need to include additional files\"\n    - label: \"Cancel\"\n      description: \"Don't commit right now\"\n```\n\nDisplay the proposed commit message clearly before asking.\n\n### Phase 5: Execute Commit\n\n1. **Stage files** (if not already staged):\n   ```bash\n   git add <files>\n   ```\n\n2. **Create commit** using HEREDOC for proper formatting:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   {module emoji}{type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n   {body if present}\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Confirm success:**\n   ```bash\n   git log -1 --oneline\n   ```\n\n### Phase 6: Report Result\n\nDisplay:\n```\n✓ Committed: {short hash} {commit message first line}\n\n📊 Stats: {files changed}, {insertions}+, {deletions}-\n\n🌿 Branch: {branch-name}\n```\n\n## Smart Staging Logic\n\nWhen unstaged changes exist across multiple areas:\n\n1. **Single logical change:** Stage all related files automatically\n2. **Multiple logical changes:** Present options via `AskUserQuestion`:\n   ```\n   question: \"Multiple changes detected. Which to commit first?\"\n   options:\n     - \"Module A changes (3 files)\"\n     - \"Module B changes (2 files)\"\n     - \"All changes together\"\n     - \"Let me specify\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Mixed concerns:** Warn and suggest splitting:\n   - \"These changes span unrelated modules. Recommend separate commits.\"\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore committing, verify:\n- [ ] No `console.log` or debug statements (unless intentional)\n- [ ] No TODO comments that should be addressed first\n- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or sensitive data\n- [ ] Changes are complete (no half-finished work)\n- [ ] Commit message accurately describes changes\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Nothing to Commit\nIf no changes exist:\n```\nℹ️ No changes to commit.\n   Working tree is clean.\n```\n\n### Merge Conflicts\nIf conflicts exist:\n```\n⚠️ Cannot commit: merge conflicts present.\n   Resolve conflicts first, then commit.\n```\n\n### Detached HEAD\nIf in detached HEAD state:\n```\n⚠️ Warning: You're in detached HEAD state.\n   Consider creating a branch before committing.\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Called by:**\n- `work-session` skill - After completing each scratchpad task\n- User directly via natural language\n\n**Works with:**\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Module emojis and conventions\n- Scratchpad - Context for what was being worked on\n\n## Project-Specific Adaptations\n\nThe skill reads the project's CLAUDE.md to determine:\n- Module names and their emojis\n- Commit message conventions (if custom)\n- Scope naming patterns\n\n**Example from a project CLAUDE.md:**\n```markdown\n## Project Modules\n- **api** 🌐: REST API endpoints\n- **frontend** 🎨: React UI components\n- **database** 🗄️: Database layer\n```\n\nThis skill would then use 🌐 for api changes, 🎨 for frontend changes, etc.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Create atomic commits (one logical change)\n- Write meaningful commit messages\n- Reference issues when applicable\n- Stage related files together\n- Use project-specific module emojis\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Commit unrelated changes together\n- Use vague messages like \"updates\" or \"fixes\"\n- Include debugging code\n- Commit secrets or credentials\n- Skip the body when context is needed\n- Add Claude attribution to commit messages\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29\n**Maintained By:** Escapement\n**Converted From:** commands/commit.md\n"

Perfect! I have the context. Based on the changes (renaming skill directories and updating frontmatter), I'll craft a commit message following the project conventions.

**Proposed commit message:**

```
🎯♻️ refactor(skills): Rename skills to verb-noun pattern

- issue-setup → setup-work  
- work-session → do-work

Establishes consistent verb-noun naming convention across all skills.
Updated both directory names and skill frontmatter name fields.

Part of #19
```

This skill analyzes changes, crafts meaningful commit messages, and ensures commits are atomic and purposeful.\n\n## Natural Language Triggers\n\nThis skill activates when the user says things like:\n- \"Commit these changes\"\n- \"Create a commit\"\n- \"Commit this\"\n- \"Save my changes\"\n- \"Make a commit for this work\"\n- After completing a scratchpad task: \"Done with this task, commit it\"\n\n## Workflow Execution\n\n### Phase 1: Gather Context (Parallel)\n\nExecute these in parallel for efficiency:\n\n1. **Project Context:**\n   - Read project's `CLAUDE.md` for module emojis and conventions\n   - Identify current development phase/priorities\n\n2. **Git Context:**\n   - `git status` - See staged/unstaged changes\n   - `git diff --cached` - Review staged changes (if any)\n   - `git diff` - Review unstaged changes\n   - `git branch --show-current` - Current branch\n   - `git log --oneline -5` - Recent commits for style reference\n\n### Phase 2: Analyze Changes\n\n1. **Categorize Changes:**\n   - Which files are modified/added/deleted?\n   - Which module(s) are affected?\n   - What type of change is this? (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)\n\n2. **Staging Decision:**\n   - If nothing staged but changes exist: Determine what should be staged together\n   - Group logically related changes\n   - Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit\n   - If multiple logical changes exist, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which to commit first\n\n3. **Validate Commit-Worthiness:**\n   - Ensure changes represent one logical unit of work\n   - Check for debugging code, console.logs, temp files\n   - Verify no secrets or sensitive data included\n\n### Phase 3: Craft Commit Message\n\n**Format:**\n```\n{module emoji}{change type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n{optional body explaining what and why}\n```\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Module Emoji:** From project's CLAUDE.md\n   - Check `## Project Modules` section for project-specific emojis\n   - Default examples: 🌐 api, 🎨 frontend, 🗄️ database, 🔐 auth, 📚 docs\n   - Use the most specific module that applies\n\n2. **Change Type Emoji:**\n   - ✨ feat: New feature\n   - 🐛 fix: Bug fix\n   - 📝 docs: Documentation\n   - 💄 style: Formatting/style\n   - ♻️ refactor: Code refactoring\n   - ⚡️ perf: Performance improvements\n   - ✅ test: Tests\n   - 🔧 chore: Tooling, configuration\n   - 🚀 ci: CI/CD improvements\n   - 🔥 fix: Remove code or files\n   - 🎨 style: Improve structure/format\n   - 🚑️ fix: Critical hotfix\n   - 🎉 chore: Begin a project\n   - 🏗️ refactor: Architectural changes\n   - 🏷️ feat: Add or update types\n   - ⚰️ refactor: Remove dead code\n\n3. **Type:** Conventional commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci)\n\n4. **Scope:** Module name from CLAUDE.md (e.g., api, frontend, skills)\n\n5. **Description:**\n   - Imperative mood (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n   - No period at end\n   - Under 50 characters\n   - Focus on capability/value added\n\n6. **Body (optional):**\n   - Explain what and why, not how\n   - Context for the change\n   - Reference issue numbers if applicable\n\n### Phase 4: Confirm with User\n\nUse `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the commit:\n\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"Ready to commit with this message?\"\n  header: \"Commit\"\n  options:\n    - label: \"Yes, commit\"\n      description: \"Create the commit with this message\"\n    - label: \"Edit message\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the commit message\"\n    - label: \"Stage more files\"\n      description: \"I need to include additional files\"\n    - label: \"Cancel\"\n      description: \"Don't commit right now\"\n```\n\nDisplay the proposed commit message clearly before asking.\n\n### Phase 5: Execute Commit\n\n1. **Stage files** (if not already staged):\n   ```bash\n   git add <files>\n   ```\n\n2. **Create commit** using HEREDOC for proper formatting:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   {module emoji}{type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n   {body if present}\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Confirm success:**\n   ```bash\n   git log -1 --oneline\n   ```\n\n### Phase 6: Report Result\n\nDisplay:\n```\n✓ Committed: {short hash} {commit message first line}\n\n📊 Stats: {files changed}, {insertions}+, {deletions}-\n\n🌿 Branch: {branch-name}\n```\n\n## Smart Staging Logic\n\nWhen unstaged changes exist across multiple areas:\n\n1. **Single logical change:** Stage all related files automatically\n2. **Multiple logical changes:** Present options via `AskUserQuestion`:\n   ```\n   question: \"Multiple changes detected. Which to commit first?\"\n   options:\n     - \"Module A changes (3 files)\"\n     - \"Module B changes (2 files)\"\n     - \"All changes together\"\n     - \"Let me specify\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Mixed concerns:** Warn and suggest splitting:\n   - \"These changes span unrelated modules. Recommend separate commits.\"\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore committing, verify:\n- [ ] No `console.log` or debug statements (unless intentional)\n- [ ] No TODO comments that should be addressed first\n- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or sensitive data\n- [ ] Changes are complete (no half-finished work)\n- [ ] Commit message accurately describes changes\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Nothing to Commit\nIf no changes exist:\n```\nℹ️ No changes to commit.\n   Working tree is clean.\n```\n\n### Merge Conflicts\nIf conflicts exist:\n```\n⚠️ Cannot commit: merge conflicts present.\n   Resolve conflicts first, then commit.\n```\n\n### Detached HEAD\nIf in detached HEAD state:\n```\n⚠️ Warning: You're in detached HEAD state.\n   Consider creating a branch before committing.\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Called by:**\n- `work-session` skill - After completing each scratchpad task\n- User directly via natural language\n\n**Works with:**\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Module emojis and conventions\n- Scratchpad - Context for what was being worked on\n\n## Project-Specific Adaptations\n\nThe skill reads the project's CLAUDE.md to determine:\n- Module names and their emojis\n- Commit message conventions (if custom)\n- Scope naming patterns\n\n**Example from a project CLAUDE.md:**\n```markdown\n## Project Modules\n- **api** 🌐: REST API endpoints\n- **frontend** 🎨: React UI components\n- **database** 🗄️: Database layer\n```\n\nThis skill would then use 🌐 for api changes, 🎨 for frontend changes, etc.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Create atomic commits (one logical change)\n- Write meaningful commit messages\n- Reference issues when applicable\n- Stage related files together\n- Use project-specific module emojis\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Commit unrelated changes together\n- Use vague messages like \"updates\" or \"fixes\"\n- Include debugging code\n- Commit secrets or credentials\n- Skip the body when context is needed\n- Add Claude attribution to commit messages\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29\n**Maintained By:** Escapement\n**Converted From:** commands/commit.md\n"

This skill analyzes changes, crafts meaningful commit messages, and ensures commits are atomic and purposeful.\n\n## Natural Language Triggers\n\nThis skill activates when the user says things like:\n- \"Commit these changes\"\n- \"Create a commit\"\n- \"Commit this\"\n- \"Save my changes\"\n- \"Make a commit for this work\"\n- After completing a scratchpad task: \"Done with this task, commit it\"\n\n## Workflow Execution\n\n### Phase 1: Gather Context (Parallel)\n\nExecute these in parallel for efficiency:\n\n1. **Project Context:**\n   - Read project's `CLAUDE.md` for module emojis and conventions\n   - Identify current development phase/priorities\n\n2. **Git Context:**\n   - `git status` - See staged/unstaged changes\n   - `git diff --cached` - Review staged changes (if any)\n   - `git diff` - Review unstaged changes\n   - `git branch --show-current` - Current branch\n   - `git log --oneline -5` - Recent commits for style reference\n\n### Phase 2: Analyze Changes\n\n1. **Categorize Changes:**\n   - Which files are modified/added/deleted?\n   - Which module(s) are affected?\n   - What type of change is this? (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)\n\n2. **Staging Decision:**\n   - If nothing staged but changes exist: Determine what should be staged together\n   - Group logically related changes\n   - Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit\n   - If multiple logical changes exist, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which to commit first\n\n3. **Validate Commit-Worthiness:**\n   - Ensure changes represent one logical unit of work\n   - Check for debugging code, console.logs, temp files\n   - Verify no secrets or sensitive data included\n\n### Phase 3: Craft Commit Message\n\n**Format:**\n```\n{module emoji}{change type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n{optional body explaining what and why}\n```\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Module Emoji:** From project's CLAUDE.md\n   - Check `## Project Modules` section for project-specific emojis\n   - Default examples: 🌐 api, 🎨 frontend, 🗄️ database, 🔐 auth, 📚 docs\n   - Use the most specific module that applies\n\n2. **Change Type Emoji:**\n   - ✨ feat: New feature\n   - 🐛 fix: Bug fix\n   - 📝 docs: Documentation\n   - 💄 style: Formatting/style\n   - ♻️ refactor: Code refactoring\n   - ⚡️ perf: Performance improvements\n   - ✅ test: Tests\n   - 🔧 chore: Tooling, configuration\n   - 🚀 ci: CI/CD improvements\n   - 🔥 fix: Remove code or files\n   - 🎨 style: Improve structure/format\n   - 🚑️ fix: Critical hotfix\n   - 🎉 chore: Begin a project\n   - 🏗️ refactor: Architectural changes\n   - 🏷️ feat: Add or update types\n   - ⚰️ refactor: Remove dead code\n\n3. **Type:** Conventional commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci)\n\n4. **Scope:** Module name from CLAUDE.md (e.g., api, frontend, skills)\n\n5. **Description:**\n   - Imperative mood (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n   - No period at end\n   - Under 50 characters\n   - Focus on capability/value added\n\n6. **Body (optional):**\n   - Explain what and why, not how\n   - Context for the change\n   - Reference issue numbers if applicable\n\n### Phase 4: Confirm with User\n\nUse `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the commit:\n\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"Ready to commit with this message?\"\n  header: \"Commit\"\n  options:\n    - label: \"Yes, commit\"\n      description: \"Create the commit with this message\"\n    - label: \"Edit message\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the commit message\"\n    - label: \"Stage more files\"\n      description: \"I need to include additional files\"\n    - label: \"Cancel\"\n      description: \"Don't commit right now\"\n```\n\nDisplay the proposed commit message clearly before asking.\n\n### Phase 5: Execute Commit\n\n1. **Stage files** (if not already staged):\n   ```bash\n   git add <files>\n   ```\n\n2. **Create commit** using HEREDOC for proper formatting:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   {module emoji}{type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n   {body if present}\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Confirm success:**\n   ```bash\n   git log -1 --oneline\n   ```\n\n### Phase 6: Report Result\n\nDisplay:\n```\n✓ Committed: {short hash} {commit message first line}\n\n📊 Stats: {files changed}, {insertions}+, {deletions}-\n\n🌿 Branch: {branch-name}\n```\n\n## Smart Staging Logic\n\nWhen unstaged changes exist across multiple areas:\n\n1. **Single logical change:** Stage all related files automatically\n2. **Multiple logical changes:** Present options via `AskUserQuestion`:\n   ```\n   question: \"Multiple changes detected. Which to commit first?\"\n   options:\n     - \"Module A changes (3 files)\"\n     - \"Module B changes (2 files)\"\n     - \"All changes together\"\n     - \"Let me specify\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Mixed concerns:** Warn and suggest splitting:\n   - \"These changes span unrelated modules. Recommend separate commits.\"\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore committing, verify:\n- [ ] No `console.log` or debug statements (unless intentional)\n- [ ] No TODO comments that should be addressed first\n- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or sensitive data\n- [ ] Changes are complete (no half-finished work)\n- [ ] Commit message accurately describes changes\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Nothing to Commit\nIf no changes exist:\n```\nℹ️ No changes to commit.\n   Working tree is clean.\n```\n\n### Merge Conflicts\nIf conflicts exist:\n```\n⚠️ Cannot commit: merge conflicts present.\n   Resolve conflicts first, then commit.\n```\n\n### Detached HEAD\nIf in detached HEAD state:\n```\n⚠️ Warning: You're in detached HEAD state.\n   Consider creating a branch before committing.\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Called by:**\n- `work-session` skill - After completing each scratchpad task\n- User directly via natural language\n\n**Works with:**\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Module emojis and conventions\n- Scratchpad - Context for what was being worked on\n\n## Project-Specific Adaptations\n\nThe skill reads the project's CLAUDE.md to determine:\n- Module names and their emojis\n- Commit message conventions (if custom)\n- Scope naming patterns\n\n**Example from a project CLAUDE.md:**\n```markdown\n## Project Modules\n- **api** 🌐: REST API endpoints\n- **frontend** 🎨: React UI components\n- **database** 🗄️: Database layer\n```\n\nThis skill would then use 🌐 for api changes, 🎨 for frontend changes, etc.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Create atomic commits (one logical change)\n- Write meaningful commit messages\n- Reference issues when applicable\n- Stage related files together\n- Use project-specific module emojis\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Commit unrelated changes together\n- Use vague messages like \"updates\" or \"fixes\"\n- Include debugging code\n- Commit secrets or credentials\n- Skip the body when context is needed\n- Add Claude attribution to commit messages\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29\n**Maintained By:** Escapement\n**Converted From:** commands/commit.md\n"

This skill analyzes changes, crafts meaningful commit messages, and ensures commits are atomic and purposeful.\n\n## Natural Language Triggers\n\nThis skill activates when the user says things like:\n- \"Commit these changes\"\n- \"Create a commit\"\n- \"Commit this\"\n- \"Save my changes\"\n- \"Make a commit for this work\"\n- After completing a scratchpad task: \"Done with this task, commit it\"\n\n## Workflow Execution\n\n### Phase 1: Gather Context (Parallel)\n\nExecute these in parallel for efficiency:\n\n1. **Project Context:**\n   - Read project's `CLAUDE.md` for module emojis and conventions\n   - Identify current development phase/priorities\n\n2. **Git Context:**\n   - `git status` - See staged/unstaged changes\n   - `git diff --cached` - Review staged changes (if any)\n   - `git diff` - Review unstaged changes\n   - `git branch --show-current` - Current branch\n   - `git log --oneline -5` - Recent commits for style reference\n\n### Phase 2: Analyze Changes\n\n1. **Categorize Changes:**\n   - Which files are modified/added/deleted?\n   - Which module(s) are affected?\n   - What type of change is this? (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)\n\n2. **Staging Decision:**\n   - If nothing staged but changes exist: Determine what should be staged together\n   - Group logically related changes\n   - Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit\n   - If multiple logical changes exist, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which to commit first\n\n3. **Validate Commit-Worthiness:**\n   - Ensure changes represent one logical unit of work\n   - Check for debugging code, console.logs, temp files\n   - Verify no secrets or sensitive data included\n\n### Phase 3: Craft Commit Message\n\n**Format:**\n```\n{module emoji}{change type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n{optional body explaining what and why}\n```\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Module Emoji:** From project's CLAUDE.md\n   - Check `## Project Modules` section for project-specific emojis\n   - Default examples: 🌐 api, 🎨 frontend, 🗄️ database, 🔐 auth, 📚 docs\n   - Use the most specific module that applies\n\n2. **Change Type Emoji:**\n   - ✨ feat: New feature\n   - 🐛 fix: Bug fix\n   - 📝 docs: Documentation\n   - 💄 style: Formatting/style\n   - ♻️ refactor: Code refactoring\n   - ⚡️ perf: Performance improvements\n   - ✅ test: Tests\n   - 🔧 chore: Tooling, configuration\n   - 🚀 ci: CI/CD improvements\n   - 🔥 fix: Remove code or files\n   - 🎨 style: Improve structure/format\n   - 🚑️ fix: Critical hotfix\n   - 🎉 chore: Begin a project\n   - 🏗️ refactor: Architectural changes\n   - 🏷️ feat: Add or update types\n   - ⚰️ refactor: Remove dead code\n\n3. **Type:** Conventional commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci)\n\n4. **Scope:** Module name from CLAUDE.md (e.g., api, frontend, skills)\n\n5. **Description:**\n   - Imperative mood (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n   - No period at end\n   - Under 50 characters\n   - Focus on capability/value added\n\n6. **Body (optional):**\n   - Explain what and why, not how\n   - Context for the change\n   - Reference issue numbers if applicable\n\n### Phase 4: Confirm with User\n\nUse `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the commit:\n\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"Ready to commit with this message?\"\n  header: \"Commit\"\n  options:\n    - label: \"Yes, commit\"\n      description: \"Create the commit with this message\"\n    - label: \"Edit message\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the commit message\"\n    - label: \"Stage more files\"\n      description: \"I need to include additional files\"\n    - label: \"Cancel\"\n      description: \"Don't commit right now\"\n```\n\nDisplay the proposed commit message clearly before asking.\n\n### Phase 5: Execute Commit\n\n1. **Stage files** (if not already staged):\n   ```bash\n   git add <files>\n   ```\n\n2. **Create commit** using HEREDOC for proper formatting:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   {module emoji}{type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n   {body if present}\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Confirm success:**\n   ```bash\n   git log -1 --oneline\n   ```\n\n### Phase 6: Report Result\n\nDisplay:\n```\n✓ Committed: {short hash} {commit message first line}\n\n📊 Stats: {files changed}, {insertions}+, {deletions}-\n\n🌿 Branch: {branch-name}\n```\n\n## Smart Staging Logic\n\nWhen unstaged changes exist across multiple areas:\n\n1. **Single logical change:** Stage all related files automatically\n2. **Multiple logical changes:** Present options via `AskUserQuestion`:\n   ```\n   question: \"Multiple changes detected. Which to commit first?\"\n   options:\n     - \"Module A changes (3 files)\"\n     - \"Module B changes (2 files)\"\n     - \"All changes together\"\n     - \"Let me specify\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Mixed concerns:** Warn and suggest splitting:\n   - \"These changes span unrelated modules. Recommend separate commits.\"\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore committing, verify:\n- [ ] No `console.log` or debug statements (unless intentional)\n- [ ] No TODO comments that should be addressed first\n- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or sensitive data\n- [ ] Changes are complete (no half-finished work)\n- [ ] Commit message accurately describes changes\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Nothing to Commit\nIf no changes exist:\n```\nℹ️ No changes to commit.\n   Working tree is clean.\n```\n\n### Merge Conflicts\nIf conflicts exist:\n```\n⚠️ Cannot commit: merge conflicts present.\n   Resolve conflicts first, then commit.\n```\n\n### Detached HEAD\nIf in detached HEAD state:\n```\n⚠️ Warning: You're in detached HEAD state.\n   Consider creating a branch before committing.\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Called by:**\n- `work-session` skill - After completing each scratchpad task\n- User directly via natural language\n\n**Works with:**\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Module emojis and conventions\n- Scratchpad - Context for what was being worked on\n\n## Project-Specific Adaptations\n\nThe skill reads the project's CLAUDE.md to determine:\n- Module names and their emojis\n- Commit message conventions (if custom)\n- Scope naming patterns\n\n**Example from a project CLAUDE.md:**\n```markdown\n## Project Modules\n- **api** 🌐: REST API endpoints\n- **frontend** 🎨: React UI components\n- **database** 🗄️: Database layer\n```\n\nThis skill would then use 🌐 for api changes, 🎨 for frontend changes, etc.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Create atomic commits (one logical change)\n- Write meaningful commit messages\n- Reference issues when applicable\n- Stage related files together\n- Use project-specific module emojis\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Commit unrelated changes together\n- Use vague messages like \"updates\" or \"fixes\"\n- Include debugging code\n- Commit secrets or credentials\n- Skip the body when context is needed\n- Add Claude attribution to commit messages\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29\n**Maintained By:** Escapement\n**Converted From:** commands/commit.md\n"

This skill analyzes changes, crafts meaningful commit messages, and ensures commits are atomic and purposeful.\n\n## Natural Language Triggers\n\nThis skill activates when the user says things like:\n- \"Commit these changes\"\n- \"Create a commit\"\n- \"Commit this\"\n- \"Save my changes\"\n- \"Make a commit for this work\"\n- After completing a scratchpad task: \"Done with this task, commit it\"\n\n## Workflow Execution\n\n### Phase 1: Gather Context (Parallel)\n\nExecute these in parallel for efficiency:\n\n1. **Project Context:**\n   - Read project's `CLAUDE.md` for module emojis and conventions\n   - Identify current development phase/priorities\n\n2. **Git Context:**\n   - `git status` - See staged/unstaged changes\n   - `git diff --cached` - Review staged changes (if any)\n   - `git diff` - Review unstaged changes\n   - `git branch --show-current` - Current branch\n   - `git log --oneline -5` - Recent commits for style reference\n\n### Phase 2: Analyze Changes\n\n1. **Categorize Changes:**\n   - Which files are modified/added/deleted?\n   - Which module(s) are affected?\n   - What type of change is this? (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)\n\n2. **Staging Decision:**\n   - If nothing staged but changes exist: Determine what should be staged together\n   - Group logically related changes\n   - Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit\n   - If multiple logical changes exist, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which to commit first\n\n3. **Validate Commit-Worthiness:**\n   - Ensure changes represent one logical unit of work\n   - Check for debugging code, console.logs, temp files\n   - Verify no secrets or sensitive data included\n\n### Phase 3: Craft Commit Message\n\n**Format:**\n```\n{module emoji}{change type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n{optional body explaining what and why}\n```\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Module Emoji:** From project's CLAUDE.md\n   - Check `## Project Modules` section for project-specific emojis\n   - Default examples: 🌐 api, 🎨 frontend, 🗄️ database, 🔐 auth, 📚 docs\n   - Use the most specific module that applies\n\n2. **Change Type Emoji:**\n   - ✨ feat: New feature\n   - 🐛 fix: Bug fix\n   - 📝 docs: Documentation\n   - 💄 style: Formatting/style\n   - ♻️ refactor: Code refactoring\n   - ⚡️ perf: Performance improvements\n   - ✅ test: Tests\n   - 🔧 chore: Tooling, configuration\n   - 🚀 ci: CI/CD improvements\n   - 🔥 fix: Remove code or files\n   - 🎨 style: Improve structure/format\n   - 🚑️ fix: Critical hotfix\n   - 🎉 chore: Begin a project\n   - 🏗️ refactor: Architectural changes\n   - 🏷️ feat: Add or update types\n   - ⚰️ refactor: Remove dead code\n\n3. **Type:** Conventional commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci)\n\n4. **Scope:** Module name from CLAUDE.md (e.g., api, frontend, skills)\n\n5. **Description:**\n   - Imperative mood (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n   - No period at end\n   - Under 50 characters\n   - Focus on capability/value added\n\n6. **Body (optional):**\n   - Explain what and why, not how\n   - Context for the change\n   - Reference issue numbers if applicable\n\n### Phase 4: Confirm with User\n\nUse `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the commit:\n\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"Ready to commit with this message?\"\n  header: \"Commit\"\n  options:\n    - label: \"Yes, commit\"\n      description: \"Create the commit with this message\"\n    - label: \"Edit message\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the commit message\"\n    - label: \"Stage more files\"\n      description: \"I need to include additional files\"\n    - label: \"Cancel\"\n      description: \"Don't commit right now\"\n```\n\nDisplay the proposed commit message clearly before asking.\n\n### Phase 5: Execute Commit\n\n1. **Stage files** (if not already staged):\n   ```bash\n   git add <files>\n   ```\n\n2. **Create commit** using HEREDOC for proper formatting:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   {module emoji}{type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n   {body if present}\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Confirm success:**\n   ```bash\n   git log -1 --oneline\n   ```\n\n### Phase 6: Report Result\n\nDisplay:\n```\n✓ Committed: {short hash} {commit message first line}\n\n📊 Stats: {files changed}, {insertions}+, {deletions}-\n\n🌿 Branch: {branch-name}\n```\n\n## Smart Staging Logic\n\nWhen unstaged changes exist across multiple areas:\n\n1. **Single logical change:** Stage all related files automatically\n2. **Multiple logical changes:** Present options via `AskUserQuestion`:\n   ```\n   question: \"Multiple changes detected. Which to commit first?\"\n   options:\n     - \"Module A changes (3 files)\"\n     - \"Module B changes (2 files)\"\n     - \"All changes together\"\n     - \"Let me specify\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Mixed concerns:** Warn and suggest splitting:\n   - \"These changes span unrelated modules. Recommend separate commits.\"\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore committing, verify:\n- [ ] No `console.log` or debug statements (unless intentional)\n- [ ] No TODO comments that should be addressed first\n- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or sensitive data\n- [ ] Changes are complete (no half-finished work)\n- [ ] Commit message accurately describes changes\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Nothing to Commit\nIf no changes exist:\n```\nℹ️ No changes to commit.\n   Working tree is clean.\n```\n\n### Merge Conflicts\nIf conflicts exist:\n```\n⚠️ Cannot commit: merge conflicts present.\n   Resolve conflicts first, then commit.\n```\n\n### Detached HEAD\nIf in detached HEAD state:\n```\n⚠️ Warning: You're in detached HEAD state.\n   Consider creating a branch before committing.\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Called by:**\n- `work-session` skill - After completing each scratchpad task\n- User directly via natural language\n\n**Works with:**\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Module emojis and conventions\n- Scratchpad - Context for what was being worked on\n\n## Project-Specific Adaptations\n\nThe skill reads the project's CLAUDE.md to determine:\n- Module names and their emojis\n- Commit message conventions (if custom)\n- Scope naming patterns\n\n**Example from a project CLAUDE.md:**\n```markdown\n## Project Modules\n- **api** 🌐: REST API endpoints\n- **frontend** 🎨: React UI components\n- **database** 🗄️: Database layer\n```\n\nThis skill would then use 🌐 for api changes, 🎨 for frontend changes, etc.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Create atomic commits (one logical change)\n- Write meaningful commit messages\n- Reference issues when applicable\n- Stage related files together\n- Use project-specific module emojis\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Commit unrelated changes together\n- Use vague messages like \"updates\" or \"fixes\"\n- Include debugging code\n- Commit secrets or credentials\n- Skip the body when context is needed\n- Add Claude attribution to commit messages\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29\n**Maintained By:** Escapement\n**Converted From:** commands/commit.md\n"

This skill analyzes changes, crafts meaningful commit messages, and ensures commits are atomic and purposeful.\n\n## Natural Language Triggers\n\nThis skill activates when the user says things like:\n- \"Commit these changes\"\n- \"Create a commit\"\n- \"Commit this\"\n- \"Save my changes\"\n- \"Make a commit for this work\"\n- After completing a scratchpad task: \"Done with this task, commit it\"\n\n## Workflow Execution\n\n### Phase 1: Gather Context (Parallel)\n\nExecute these in parallel for efficiency:\n\n1. **Project Context:**\n   - Read project's `CLAUDE.md` for module emojis and conventions\n   - Identify current development phase/priorities\n\n2. **Git Context:**\n   - `git status` - See staged/unstaged changes\n   - `git diff --cached` - Review staged changes (if any)\n   - `git diff` - Review unstaged changes\n   - `git branch --show-current` - Current branch\n   - `git log --oneline -5` - Recent commits for style reference\n\n### Phase 2: Analyze Changes\n\n1. **Categorize Changes:**\n   - Which files are modified/added/deleted?\n   - Which module(s) are affected?\n   - What type of change is this? (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)\n\n2. **Staging Decision:**\n   - If nothing staged but changes exist: Determine what should be staged together\n   - Group logically related changes\n   - Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit\n   - If multiple logical changes exist, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which to commit first\n\n3. **Validate Commit-Worthiness:**\n   - Ensure changes represent one logical unit of work\n   - Check for debugging code, console.logs, temp files\n   - Verify no secrets or sensitive data included\n\n### Phase 3: Craft Commit Message\n\n**Format:**\n```\n{module emoji}{change type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n{optional body explaining what and why}\n```\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Module Emoji:** From project's CLAUDE.md\n   - Check `## Project Modules` section for project-specific emojis\n   - Default examples: 🌐 api, 🎨 frontend, 🗄️ database, 🔐 auth, 📚 docs\n   - Use the most specific module that applies\n\n2. **Change Type Emoji:**\n   - ✨ feat: New feature\n   - 🐛 fix: Bug fix\n   - 📝 docs: Documentation\n   - 💄 style: Formatting/style\n   - ♻️ refactor: Code refactoring\n   - ⚡️ perf: Performance improvements\n   - ✅ test: Tests\n   - 🔧 chore: Tooling, configuration\n   - 🚀 ci: CI/CD improvements\n   - 🔥 fix: Remove code or files\n   - 🎨 style: Improve structure/format\n   - 🚑️ fix: Critical hotfix\n   - 🎉 chore: Begin a project\n   - 🏗️ refactor: Architectural changes\n   - 🏷️ feat: Add or update types\n   - ⚰️ refactor: Remove dead code\n\n3. **Type:** Conventional commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci)\n\n4. **Scope:** Module name from CLAUDE.md (e.g., api, frontend, skills)\n\n5. **Description:**\n   - Imperative mood (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n   - No period at end\n   - Under 50 characters\n   - Focus on capability/value added\n\n6. **Body (optional):**\n   - Explain what and why, not how\n   - Context for the change\n   - Reference issue numbers if applicable\n\n### Phase 4: Confirm with User\n\nUse `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the commit:\n\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"Ready to commit with this message?\"\n  header: \"Commit\"\n  options:\n    - label: \"Yes, commit\"\n      description: \"Create the commit with this message\"\n    - label: \"Edit message\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the commit message\"\n    - label: \"Stage more files\"\n      description: \"I need to include additional files\"\n    - label: \"Cancel\"\n      description: \"Don't commit right now\"\n```\n\nDisplay the proposed commit message clearly before asking.\n\n### Phase 5: Execute Commit\n\n1. **Stage files** (if not already staged):\n   ```bash\n   git add <files>\n   ```\n\n2. **Create commit** using HEREDOC for proper formatting:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   {module emoji}{type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n   {body if present}\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Confirm success:**\n   ```bash\n   git log -1 --oneline\n   ```\n\n### Phase 6: Report Result\n\nDisplay:\n```\n✓ Committed: {short hash} {commit message first line}\n\n📊 Stats: {files changed}, {insertions}+, {deletions}-\n\n🌿 Branch: {branch-name}\n```\n\n## Smart Staging Logic\n\nWhen unstaged changes exist across multiple areas:\n\n1. **Single logical change:** Stage all related files automatically\n2. **Multiple logical changes:** Present options via `AskUserQuestion`:\n   ```\n   question: \"Multiple changes detected. Which to commit first?\"\n   options:\n     - \"Module A changes (3 files)\"\n     - \"Module B changes (2 files)\"\n     - \"All changes together\"\n     - \"Let me specify\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Mixed concerns:** Warn and suggest splitting:\n   - \"These changes span unrelated modules. Recommend separate commits.\"\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore committing, verify:\n- [ ] No `console.log` or debug statements (unless intentional)\n- [ ] No TODO comments that should be addressed first\n- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or sensitive data\n- [ ] Changes are complete (no half-finished work)\n- [ ] Commit message accurately describes changes\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Nothing to Commit\nIf no changes exist:\n```\nℹ️ No changes to commit.\n   Working tree is clean.\n```\n\n### Merge Conflicts\nIf conflicts exist:\n```\n⚠️ Cannot commit: merge conflicts present.\n   Resolve conflicts first, then commit.\n```\n\n### Detached HEAD\nIf in detached HEAD state:\n```\n⚠️ Warning: You're in detached HEAD state.\n   Consider creating a branch before committing.\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Called by:**\n- `work-session` skill - After completing each scratchpad task\n- User directly via natural language\n\n**Works with:**\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Module emojis and conventions\n- Scratchpad - Context for what was being worked on\n\n## Project-Specific Adaptations\n\nThe skill reads the project's CLAUDE.md to determine:\n- Module names and their emojis\n- Commit message conventions (if custom)\n- Scope naming patterns\n\n**Example from a project CLAUDE.md:**\n```markdown\n## Project Modules\n- **api** 🌐: REST API endpoints\n- **frontend** 🎨: React UI components\n- **database** 🗄️: Database layer\n```\n\nThis skill would then use 🌐 for api changes, 🎨 for frontend changes, etc.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Create atomic commits (one logical change)\n- Write meaningful commit messages\n- Reference issues when applicable\n- Stage related files together\n- Use project-specific module emojis\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Commit unrelated changes together\n- Use vague messages like \"updates\" or \"fixes\"\n- Include debugging code\n- Commit secrets or credentials\n- Skip the body when context is needed\n- Add Claude attribution to commit messages\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29\n**Maintained By:** Escapement\n**Converted From:** commands/commit.md\n"

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation to create a comprehensive summary:

1. **User's Initial Request**: "setup issue 19" - The user invoked the escapement plugin's issue-setup skill to prepare issue #19 for development work.

2. **Skill Execution - Issue Setup**: I executed the issue-setup skill workflow which:
   - Retrieved GitHub issue #19 details
   - Created comprehensive SCRATCHPAD_19.md with implementation plan
   - Created feature branch 19-standardize-skill-naming
   - Issue proposes renaming two skills: `issue-setup` → `setup-work`, `work-session` → `do-work`

3. **User's Second Request**: "do work on issue 19" - The user requested to start implementation work using the do-work skill.

4. **Skill Execution - Do Work Session**: I invoked the do-work skill which:
   - Switched to feature branch 19-standardize-skill-naming
   - Initialized TodoWrite with 25 tasks from scratchpad
   - Began systematic execution of implementation tasks

5. **Implementation Progress**: I systematically worked through the tasks creating 5 atomic commits:
   - Commit 1: Renamed skill directories and updated frontmatter
   - Commit 2: Updated CLAUDE.md references
   - Commit 3: Updated README.md references
   - Commit 4: Updated docs/ references
   - Commit 5: Updated skill cross-references

6. **Current State**: Just completed searching for remaining references and updated agents/scratchpad-planner.md. The file is staged and ready to commit. About to create commit 6 (final verification commit per scratchpad strategy).

7. **Key Technical Details**:
   - Using git mv for directory renames
   - Following conventional commit format with emojis
   - Using Edit tool for precise file modifications
   - TodoWrite tracking 25 tasks (16 completed)
   - 5 commits created so far

8. **No Errors Encountered**: The workflow has executed smoothly without any errors.

9. **Pending Work**: 
   - Commit staged agent file
   - Test plugin loading
   - Test skill invocations (natural language and explicit)
   - Verify /help output

10. **User Messages Analysis**:
   - "setup issue 19" - Initial setup request
   - "do work on issue 19" - Start implementation request
   - Multiple commit-changes skill invocations (implicit via workflow)
   - Summary request (current message)

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user requested to work on GitHub issue #19 for the escapement project. The task involves standardizing skill naming conventions from an inconsistent pattern to a consistent verb-noun pattern. Specifically:
   - Rename `issue-setup` skill to `setup-work`
   - Rename `work-session` skill to `do-work`
   - Update all documentation, cross-references, and skill invocations throughout the codebase
   - Follow atomic commit strategy with 6 commit groups as defined in the scratchpad
   - Test the changes to ensure plugin functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Escapement plugin architecture (Claude Code plugin system)
   - Skill-based workflow automation
   - GitHub issue integration via MCP tools
   - Scratchpad-driven development methodology
   - Git feature branch workflow
   - Verb-noun naming convention pattern for skills
   - Breaking changes in skill naming (explicit invocations like `/escapement:issue-setup` will break)
   - Plugin manifest and frontmatter configuration (YAML frontmatter with `name:` field)
   - Conventional commits format with module and type emojis
   - TodoWrite progress tracking
   - Atomic commits (one logical change per commit)

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **SCRATCHPAD_19.md** (Created)
     - Why: Central implementation plan for issue #19 tracking
     - Contains 25 tasks broken into 8 groups with acceptance criteria
     - Branch strategy: feature branch `19-standardize-skill-naming` from `main`
     
   - **skills/issue-setup/** → **skills/setup-work/** (Renamed)
     - Why: Establish new directory structure for setup-work skill
     - Updated frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     name: setup-work
     description: Setup development environment from GitHub issue...
     ```
     - Updated delegation reference:
     ```markdown
     Delegating to do-work skill...
     
     Skill: do-work
     args: "{issue_number}"
     ```

   - **skills/work-session/** → **skills/do-work/** (Renamed)
     - Why: Establish new directory structure for do-work skill
     - Updated frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     name: do-work
     description: Execute development work from a scratchpad...
     ```
     - Updated setup-work references (4 locations):
     ```markdown
     Would you like to run setup-work first?
     
     - question: "No scratchpad found. Run setup-work to initialize?"
     - label: "Yes, run setup-work"
     
     Skill: setup-work
     
     **STOP here** - setup-work will create scratchpad and can chain to do-work after.
     ```

   - **CLAUDE.md** (Modified - 3 sections)
     - Why: Project documentation defining plugin architecture
     - Directory structure updated (lines 24, 28):
     ```markdown
     ├── skills/
     │   ├── setup-work/      # GitHub issue -> scratchpad -> branch
     │   ├── do-work/         # Execute work from scratchpad
     ```
     - Skills table updated (lines 56, 60):
     ```markdown
     | `setup-work` | "Setup issue #42" | Fetch issue, create scratchpad, prepare branch |
     | `do-work` | "Start working on issue #42" | Execute tasks from scratchpad with TodoWrite |
     ```
     - Scratchpad convention updated (line 128):
     ```markdown
     - **Created by**: `setup-work` skill
     ```

   - **README.md** (Modified - 11 changes)
     - Why: User-facing documentation must reflect new names
     - Workflow overview (lines 19-20):
     ```markdown
     1. **Initialize** (`setup-work`) - Pull GitHub issue → Generate scratchpad plan → Create feature branch
     2. **Execute** (`do-work` + `commit-changes`) - Work through scratchpad tasks → Make atomic commits
     ```
     - Skills table (lines 142, 146):
     ```markdown
     | `setup-work`     | "setup issue #X", "start issue #X"  | Fetch issue, create scratchpad, prepare branch |
     | `do-work`        | "start working", "continue work"    | Execute tasks from scratchpad                  |
     ```
     - Explicit invocation example (line 133):
     ```bash
     /escapement:setup-work
     ```

   - **docs/WORKFLOW.md** (Modified - 2 changes)
     - Why: Workflow documentation must use new skill names
     - Skill description (line 33):
     ```markdown
     The `setup-work` skill automatically:
     ```
     - Lifecycle description (line 238):

     ```
     - Mission description (line 21):
     ```markdown
     When invoked during setup-work Phase 2 (Analyze & Plan), you will:
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   No errors were encountered during this implementation. The workflow executed smoothly without any issues.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Systematic renaming of skills across entire codebase
   - **Solved**: Identified all cross-references between skills and updated them
   - **Solved**: Maintained atomic commit strategy with 6 logical groups
   - **Solved**: Updated both directory names and skill frontmatter name fields
   - **Solved**: Verified no remaining references in active codebase (only archived files contain old names, which is intentional)
   - **Approach**: Used parallel grep searches to find all references before making changes
   - **Approach**: Used Edit tool for precise replacements to avoid unintended changes
   - **Approach**: Followed scratchpad commit strategy for organized, reviewable changes

6. All user messages:
   - "setup issue 19" - Initial request to set up issue #19 for development
   - "do work on issue 19" - Request to start implementation work using the do-work skill
   - (Current message) - Request for detailed conversation summary

7. Pending Tasks:
   Based on the TodoWrite tracker, remaining tasks are:
   - Commit agents/scratchpad-planner.md changes (currently staged)
   - Test setup-work skill via natural language
   - Test do-work skill via natural language  
   - Test explicit invocation /escapement:setup-work
   - Test explicit invocation /escapement:do-work
   - Verify plugin loads without errors
   - Verify /help shows updated skill names

8. Current Work:
   Immediately before the summary request, I was in the process of creating the 6th commit (final verification commit per scratchpad strategy). Specifically:
   
   - Just completed searching the codebase for remaining "issue-setup" and "work-session" references
   - Found that all active codebase references have been updated (only archived files remain with old names, which is intentional per scratchpad assumptions)
   - Updated agents/scratchpad-planner.md with 3 changes to reference setup-work instead of issue-setup
   - Staged the agent file: `git add agents/scratchpad-planner.md`
   - Invoked the commit-changes skill to create the commit
   - The commit-changes skill had just been invoked and was ready to propose a commit message

   Current git status shows:
   ```
   On branch 19-standardize-skill-naming
   Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 5 commits.
   
   Changes to be committed:
     modified:   agents/scratchpad-planner.md
   
   Untracked files:
     SCRATCHPAD_19.md
   ```

   Progress: 16 of 25 tasks completed (64% complete)

9. Optional Next Step:
   The immediate next step is to complete the commit that was in progress when the summary was requested. Specifically:
   
   Direct quote from my last action: "I'll commit the agent file update. Let me stage the changes."
   
   The commit-changes skill was invoked and the file `agents/scratchpad-planner.md` is staged. The next action should be to:
   1. Propose a commit message for the agent file update (something like "📚♻️ refactor(agents): Update scratchpad-planner references to setup-work")
   2. Confirm with user and create the commit
   3. Then proceed to testing tasks as outlined in the scratchpad (verify plugin loads, test natural language invocations, test explicit invocations, verify /help output)
   
   This aligns with the scratchpad strategy which planned for 6 commit groups, and we're currently on commit 6 (final verification and cleanup)..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

Perfect! Working tree is clean with 6 commits ready.

**Configuration Verification Complete** ✓

The remaining testing tasks require runtime verification outside this work session:
- Natural language trigger testing
- Explicit invocation testing  
- Plugin loading verification
- /help output verification

These are integration tests that need to be performed by running Claude Code with the plugin loaded. I've verified all the configuration and structure is correct, but the actual runtime behavior testing should be done as a separate verification step.

This skill analyzes the branch, detects related issues, and generates comprehensive PR descriptions.\n\n## Natural Language Triggers\n\nThis skill activates when the user says things like:\n- \"Create a PR\"\n- \"Open a pull request\"\n- \"Make a PR for this work\"\n- \"Submit this for review\"\n- \"I'm ready to create a pull request\"\n- \"PR this branch\"\n- After work completion: \"Done, let's open a PR\"\n\n## Workflow Execution\n\n### Phase 1: Gather Context (Parallel)\n\nExecute these in parallel for efficiency:\n\n1. **Project Context:**\n   - Read project's `CLAUDE.md` for PR conventions\n   - Identify target branch (main, develop, etc.)\n\n2. **Branch Analysis:**\n   - `git branch --show-current` - Current branch name\n   - `git log main..HEAD --oneline` - Commits on this branch\n   - `git diff main...HEAD --stat` - Change summary\n\n3. **Remote Status:**\n   - Check if branch is pushed to remote\n   - Check if remote is up to date\n\n### Phase 2: Detect Issue Context\n\n1. **Extract Issue Reference from Branch Name:**\n\n   Common patterns:\n   - `42-feature-description` → Issue #42\n   - `feature/42-description` → Issue #42\n   - `fix/123-bug-name` → Issue #123\n   - `ABC-123-description` → Linear issue ABC-123\n\n2. **Retrieve Issue Details:**\n\n   **For GitHub Issues:**\n   ```\n   mcp__github__get_issue(owner, repo, issue_number)\n   ```\n   - Get title, description, acceptance criteria\n   - Get labels for PR labeling\n   - Check issue state (should be open)\n\n   **For Linear Issues:**\n   ```\n   mcp__linear__get_issue(id)\n   ```\n   - Get issue details and context\n\n3. **Build Context Map:**\n   - Original issue requirements\n   - Acceptance criteria to verify\n   - Related issues (blocks, depends on)\n   - Milestone/project context\n\n### Phase 3: Analyze Changes\n\n1. **Commit Analysis:**\n   - Review each commit message\n   - Identify modules affected\n   - Categorize change types (feat, fix, etc.)\n\n2. **Change Summary:**\n   - Files changed and why\n   - Key functionality added/modified\n   - Breaking changes (if any)\n\n3. **Verify Completeness:**\n   - Do commits address the issue requirements?\n   - Are acceptance criteria met?\n   - Any outstanding work?\n\n### Phase 4: Generate PR Content\n\n**PR Title:**\nFormat: `{type}: {description} (#{issue_number})`\n\nExample: `feat: Add commit-changes skill (#42)`\n\n**PR Description Template:**\n```markdown\n## Summary\n{Brief explanation aligned with original issue goals}\n\n## Issue Resolution\nCloses #{issue_number}\n\n{How this implementation addresses the original requirements}\n\n## Key Changes\n- {Module-focused change descriptions}\n- {New capabilities enabled}\n- {Breaking changes if any}\n\n## Implementation Notes\n{Any deviations from issue description}\n{Technical decisions made}\n{Trade-offs considered}\n\n## Testing\n{How this was tested}\n{What testing is appropriate for current project phase}\n\n## Checklist\n- [ ] Code follows project conventions\n- [ ] Changes are atomic and reviewable\n- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)\n- [ ] Tests added/updated (if applicable)\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Confirm with User\n\nUse `AskUserQuestion` to confirm PR details:\n\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"Ready to create this PR?\"\n  header: \"Create PR\"\n  options:\n    - label: \"Yes, create PR\"\n      description: \"Create the PR with this title and description\"\n    - label: \"Edit title\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the PR title\"\n    - label: \"Edit description\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the PR description\"\n    - label: \"Create as draft\"\n      description: \"Create as draft PR (not ready for review)\"\n    - label: \"Cancel\"\n      description: \"Don't create PR right now\"\n```\n\nDisplay the proposed title and description before asking.\n\n### Phase 6: Create Pull Request\n\n1. **Ensure branch is pushed:**\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin {branch-name}\n   ```\n\n2. **Create PR using gh CLI:**\n   ```bash\n   gh pr create \\\n     --title \"{title}\" \\\n     --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   {PR description}\n   EOF\n   )\" \\\n     --base {target-branch}\n   ```\n\n   Or use MCP GitHub tools:\n   ```\n   mcp__github__create_pull_request(...)\n   ```\n\n3. **Apply labels** (from issue + modules affected)\n\n4. **Link to issue** (auto-close on merge via \"Closes #X\")\n\n### Phase 7: Report Result\n\nDisplay:\n```\n✓ Pull Request created!\n\n🔗 PR #XX: {title}\n   {PR URL}\n\n📋 Linked to Issue #{issue_number}\n\n👀 Ready for review\n   Target: {target-branch}\n   Reviewers: {if any suggested}\n```\n\n## Auto-Configuration\n\nBased on context, automatically determine:\n\n1. **Target Branch:**\n   - Check CLAUDE.md for project conventions\n   - Default: main or develop (whichever exists)\n\n2. **Labels:**\n   - From originating issue\n   - From modules affected (if label mapping exists)\n   - Change type (enhancement, bug, etc.)\n\n3. **Draft Status:**\n   - Set draft if branch contains \"wip\" or \"draft\"\n   - Set draft if issue is incomplete\n   - Ask user if uncertain\n\n4. **Reviewers:**\n   - Suggest based on CODEOWNERS\n   - Suggest based on issue assignees\n   - Suggest based on module ownership\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### No Commits on Branch\n```\nℹ️ No commits to create PR from.\n   Branch has no changes vs {target-branch}.\n```\n\n### Branch Not Pushed\n```\n📤 Branch not on remote. Pushing now...\n   git push -u origin {branch}\n```\n\n### Issue Not Found\n```\n⚠️ Could not find issue reference in branch name.\n   Branch: {branch-name}\n\n   Would you like to:\n   1. Enter issue number manually\n   2. Create PR without issue link\n   3. Cancel\n```\n\n### PR Already Exists\n```\nℹ️ PR already exists for this branch.\n   🔗 PR #{number}: {title}\n\n   Would you like to update it instead?\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Follows:**\n- `work-session` skill - After completing all tasks\n- `commit-changes` skill - After final commit\n\n**Links to:**\n- GitHub Issues - Auto-close on merge\n- Linear Issues - Link and track\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Link PRs to originating issues\n- Write clear, context-rich descriptions\n- Include testing information\n- Note any deviations from original requirements\n- Use conventional PR titles\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Create PRs for incomplete work (use draft instead)\n- Skip the issue link\n- Write vague descriptions\n- Include unrelated changes\n- Force push after PR is created (without warning)\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29\n**Maintained By:** Escapement\n**Converted From:** commands/open-pr.md\n"

Perfect! I have the issue context. Now let me draft the PR content based on the 6 commits and issue requirements:

**Proposed PR Title:**
```
refactor: Standardize skill naming to verb-noun pattern (#19)
```

**Proposed PR Description:**
```markdown
## Summary

Standardizes all Escapement skill names to a consistent verb-noun pattern, improving discoverability and establishing a clear convention for future skills.

## Issue Resolution

Closes #19

This implementation addresses the inconsistent naming that evolved organically:
- `issue-setup` (noun-verb) → `setup-work` (verb-noun)
- `work-session` (noun-noun) → `do-work` (verb-noun)

All other skills already followed verb-noun pattern and remain unchanged.

## Key Changes

**Skill Renames:**
- 🎯 `skills/issue-setup/` → `skills/setup-work/`
- 🎯 `skills/work-session/` → `skills/do-work/`

**Documentation Updates:**
- 📚 Updated CLAUDE.md skill table and directory structure
- 📚 Updated README.md skills table and workflow narrative
- 📚 Updated docs/WORKFLOW.md and docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md
- 📚 Updated all skill cross-references and Skill() invocations
- 🔌 Updated agents/scratchpad-planner.md references

**Files Changed:** 11 files
- Skill frontmatter `name:` fields updated
- All explicit invocation examples updated
- All natural language trigger documentation updated

## Implementation Notes

**Atomic Commit Strategy:**
Implemented using 6 atomic commits following logical groupings:
1. Directory renames + frontmatter updates
2. CLAUDE.md documentation
3. README.md documentation
4. Extended docs (WORKFLOW.md, CUSTOMIZATION.md)
5. Skill cross-references
6. Agent references

**Breaking Changes:**
Explicit skill invocations now use new names:
- `/escapement:issue-setup` → `/escapement:setup-work` ⚠️
- `/escapement:work-session` → `/escapement:do-work` ⚠️

Natural language triggers updated but continue to work intuitively:
- "setup issue #X" → triggers `setup-work`
- "do work on issue #X" → triggers `do-work`

## Testing

**Configuration Verified:**
- ✅ Plugin manifest structure valid
- ✅ Skill frontmatter properly formatted
- ✅ Directory structure correct
- ✅ All cross-references updated
- ✅ No broken documentation links

**Runtime Testing Required:**
- Natural language trigger testing
- Explicit invocation testing
- Plugin loading verification
- /help output verification

## Checklist

- [x] Code follows project conventions
- [x] Changes are atomic and reviewable (6 commits)
- [x] Documentation updated throughout
- [x] Skill frontmatter and directory structure correct
- [x] Configuration verified (runtime testing pending)
```

Excellent! PR #20 has been merged. 🎉

The skill naming standardization is now live:
- ✅ `setup-work` (formerly `issue-setup`)
- ✅ `do-work` (formerly `work-session`)

Would you like me to archive the work for issue #19? This will:
- Move `SCRATCHPAD_19.md` to `docs/dev/cc-archive/`
- Create a summary README in the archive
- Clean up the project root
- Commit the archive

Should I run the archive-work skill?
