Focus on: {specific areas from issue}\"\n     description: \"Explore codebase for issue #{number}\"\n   ```\n\n   The Explore agent will:\n   - Search for relevant existing code patterns\n   - Identify affected modules/components\n   - Check for similar implementations\n   - Find integration points and dependencies\n   - Use LSP for code navigation (goToDefinition, findReferences)\n\n   **When to delegate vs. do directly:**\n   - **Delegate:** Complex features, unfamiliar codebases, multi-module changes\n   - **Direct:** Simple bugs, single-file changes, well-understood areas\n\n3. **Technical Breakdown:**\n   - Break work into atomic, committable tasks\n   - Identify integration points\n   - Flag potential challenges\n   - Estimate complexity/scope\n\n4. **Dependency Check:**\n   - Does this require other issues first? (check \"depends on\" mentions)\n   - Will this block other work? (check \"blocks\" mentions)\n   - Are there API contract implications?\n   - Check milestone dependencies\n\n### Phase 3: Create Scratchpad\n\n**Generate:** `SCRATCHPAD_{issue_number}.md`\n\n**Template Structure:**\n\n```markdown\n# {Issue Title} - #{issue_number}\n\n## Issue Details\n- **Repository:** {owner/repo}\n- **GitHub URL:** {issue_url}\n- **State:** {open/closed}\n- **Labels:** {labels}\n- **Milestone:** {milestone if exists}\n- **Assignees:** {assignees}\n- **Related Issues:** {linked issues if any}\n  -

Review the Questions/Blockers section of the scratchpad\n   - If \"Clarifications Needed\" is empty, skip to Phase 4\n   - If questions exist, proceed with interactive resolution\n\n2. **Present Questions via AskUserQuestion:**\n   For each clarification needed, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to get user input:\n\n   ```\n   AskUserQuestion:\n     question: \"{The specific clarification question}\"\n     header: \"Clarify\"\n     options:\n       - label: \"{Option A}\"\n         description: \"{What this choice means}\"\n       - label: \"{Option B}\"\n         description: \"{What this choice means}\"\n       - label: \"{Option C}\" (if applicable)\n         description: \"{What this choice means}\"\n     multiSelect: false (or true if multiple answers valid)\n   ```\n\n   **Guidelines for presenting questions:**\n   - Frame questions clearly with context\n   - Provide 2-4 concrete options when possible\n   - Include descriptions explaining implications of each choice\n   - User can always select \"Other\" for custom input\n   - Group related questions if they have dependencies\n\n3. **Update Scratchpad with Decisions:**\n   After collecting all answers, update the scratchpad:\n\n   a) **Add \"Decisions Made\" section** (if not present) under Questions/Blockers:\n   ```markdown\n   ### Decisions Made\n   {Timestamp}\n\n   **Q: {Original question}**\n   **A:** {User's answer/decision}\n   **Rationale:** {Brief explanation of why, if provided}\n   ```\n\n   b) **Remove resolved items** from \"Clarifications Needed\"\n\n   c) **Update relevant sections** if decisions affect:\n      - Implementation tasks (add/remove/modify based on decisions)\n      - Technical approach\n      - Assumptions (convert to confirmed decisions)\n\n4. **Confirm Resolution:**\n   Display summary of decisions made:\n   ```\n   ✓ Resolved {N} clarifications:\n\n   1. {Question summary} → {Decision}\n   2. {Question summary} → {Decision}\n   ...\n\n   📋 SCRATCHPAD updated with decisions.\n   ```\n\n**Example Interaction:**\n\n```\n📋 SCRATCHPAD_42.md has 3 clarifications that need resolution before proceeding.\n\n[AskUserQuestion 1/3]\nQuestion: \"Should we keep commands as aliases during the transition to skills?\"\nHeader: \"Migration\"\nOptions:\n  - \"Keep as thin wrappers\" - Commands remain but delegate to skills\n  - \"Remove immediately\" - Clean break, skills only\n  - \"Decide per-command\" - Evaluate each command individually\n\n[User selects: \"Keep as thin wrappers\"]\n\n[AskUserQuestion 2/3]\nQuestion: \"How should prime-session be handled?\"\nHeader: \"Behavior\"\nOptions:\n  - \"Convert to auto-invoke skill\" - Activates when entering new repo\n  - \"Keep as explicit command\" - User must invoke manually\n  - \"Remove entirely\" - Claude reads CLAUDE.md automatically anyway\n\n[User selects: \"Keep as explicit command\"]\n\n...\n\n✓ Resolved 3 clarifications:\n\n1. Migration strategy → Keep commands as thin wrappers\n2. prime-session behavior → Keep as explicit command\n3. ...\n\n📋 SCRATCHPAD_42.md updated with decisions.\nProceeding to branch creation...\n```\n\n**Skip Conditions:**\n- No items in \"Clarifications Needed\" → Skip directly to Phase 4\n- User explicitly requests to skip → Note unresolved questions, proceed with assumptions\n\n### Phase 4: Prepare Workspace\n\n**Branch Creation:**\n\n1. **Detect base branch:**\n   ```bash\n   # Check what branches exist\n   git fetch origin\n   \n   # Prefer in this order:\n   # 1. develop-ts (if exists)\n   # 2. develop (if exists)\n   # 3. main (default)\n   git branch -r | grep -E 'origin/(develop-ts|develop|main)'\n   ```\n\n2. **Create feature branch:**\n   ```bash\n   # Generate branch name from issue\n   # Format: {issue_number}-{slugified-title}\n   # Example: 42-implement-fact-batching\n   \n   git branch {issue-number}-{slugified-title} origin/{base-branch}\n   # Don't checkout yet - let operator decide when to switch\n   ```\n\n3. **Confirm creation:**\n   ```bash\n   git branch --list {branch-name}\n   ```\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nDisplay concise summary:\n```\n✓ Issue #{issue_number} analyzed and prepared\n\n📋 SCRATCHPAD_{issue_number}.md created with:\n   - {X} implementation tasks\n   - {Y} quality checks\n   - {Z} decisions made (via Q&A)\n\n🌿 Branch '{issue-number}-{slugified-title}' created from {base-branch}\n\n🔗 GitHub Issue: {issue_url}\n\n🚀 Ready to begin work:\n   git checkout {branch-name}\n   # Then start implementation\n```\n\n**Note:** If clarifications were resolved in Phase 3.5, the scratchpad now contains\nconfirmed decisions rather than open questions. All ambiguities should be resolved\nbefore reaching this point.\n\n## Project-Specific Adaptations\n\n### For UI/Frontend Projects:\n\n**Component Context:**\n- Which components affected?\n- State management implications?\n- API contract dependencies?\n\n### For API/Backend Projects:\n\n**Contract Context:**\n- API endpoints added/modified?\n- Breaking changes?\n- Database migrations needed?\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Issue Not Found\nIf GitHub issue doesn't exist:\n- Verify issue number and repository\n- Check if issue is in different repo\n- Offer to search issues by title/keyword\n- Confirm you have access to private repos (if applicable)\n\n### Insufficient Information\nIf issue lacks description or clear scope:\n- Note this prominently in Questions/Blockers\n- Suggest adding task list to issue before starting work\n- Don't guess - make assumptions explicit\n- Consider commenting on issue to request clarification\n\n### Branch Already Exists\nIf feature branch already exists:\n- Check if work in progress (git log)\n- Offer to resume vs. create new branch\n- Warn about potential conflicts\n- Suggest reviewing existing commits\n\n### Repository Access Issues\nIf can't access repository:\n- Verify GitHub authentication (gh auth status)\n- Check repository exists (might be private)\n- Confirm repository name spelling\n- Ensure gh CLI is installed and configured\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Flows to:**\n- `/start-work {issue_number}` - Begin execution from scratchpad\n- `/commit` - Make atomic commits as checklist progresses\n\n**Receives context from:**\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Architecture and conventions\n- `/prime-session` - Current development priorities\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Read acceptance criteria carefully\n- Break work into truly atomic commits\n- Flag ambiguities early\n- Research codebase before planning\n- Make scratchpad detailed but scannable\n- Document assumptions explicitly\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Start coding before scratchpad approved\n- Guess at unclear requirements\n- Create tasks too large to review\n- Skip codebase investigation\n- Over-engineer the plan\n- Hide complexity in vague task descriptions\n\n## Operator Interaction Points\n\n**Before Scratchpad Creation:**\nIf issue is complex or ambiguous, ask:\n- \"This issue affects multiple modules. Should we break it into sub-issues?\"\n- \"Acceptance criteria unclear on X. Should we clarify before planning?\"\n\n**After Scratchpad Created:**\nPresent for review:\n- \"I've created SCRATCHPAD_42.md. Please review the implementation plan.\"\n- \"I flagged 2 questions in the Blockers section - need clarification?\"\n\n**Before Branch Creation:**\nConfirm readiness:\n- \"Base branch develop-ts is 5 commits behind origin. Pull first?\"\n- \"Ready to create feature branch?\"\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nA successful issue setup produces:\n\n✓ **Complete context:** All issue details captured\n✓ **Clear plan:** Implementation steps are atomic and logical\n✓ **Identified risks:** Challenges flagged upfront\n✓ **Ready workspace:** Branch created, scratchpad prepared\n✓ **Operator confidence:** Developer knows exactly what to build\n\nThe scratchpad should be so clear that another developer could pick it up and execute it.\n\n### Complex Implementation Detection\n\nIf the issue analysis reveals a complex implementation, suggest entering plan mode:\n\n**Triggers for EnterPlanMode:**\n- Implementation affects more than 3-4 files\n- Multiple valid architectural approaches exist\n- Significant refactoring required\n- New patterns or abstractions needed\n- Breaking changes to existing APIs\n\n**Suggestion:**\n```\nThis issue appears complex ({reason}). Would you like me to enter\nplan mode to design the implementation approach before we proceed?\n```\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.1.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-31\n**Maintained By:** Muleteer\n**Changelog:**\n- v1.1.0: Added Task delegation to Explore agent, parallel execution, LSP integration, EnterPlanMode triggers\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 17"

Good! No existing scratchpad found. I've fetched issue #17 which is about renaming the project from "muleteer" to "escapement".

This is a substantial refactoring task. Let me analyze the codebase to identify all affected files and references:

Changing this immediately redefines how the plugin is invoked.\n\n2. **Skill Invocation Syntax**: All references to `/muleteer:skill-name` must change to `/escapement:skill-name`. This affects both documentation and user expectations.\n\n3. **Repository URL**: If the repository itself is being renamed on GitHub (which would require a separate GitHub operation), you'll need to update all repository references.\n\n4. **Deprecated Paths**: The `~/.muleteer/` paths in docs refer to v1.0's symlink-based installation. In v2.0 plugin architecture, this is no longer relevant, so those docs can be safely updated or removed.\n\n5. **Archive Files**: The historical development files in `/docs/dev/cc-archive/` preserve the development history. You may choose to leave them as-is for historical reference, or update them for consistency.\n\n---\n\n## Files That Do NOT Need Changes\n\n- Individual skill implementations (tool usage, logic)\n- Hook script functionality (`hooks/archive-session-log.sh` script logic)\n- Directory structure (the `/muleteer` directory name itself is your local path, not the plugin name)\n- `.gitignore`, `.obsidian/`, and other system files\n\nThe plugin name \"muleteer\" is defined in the plugin manifest, not by the directory path."

✓ Issue #17 analyzed and prepared

📋 **SCRATCHPAD_17.md** created with:
   - 15 implementation tasks across 5 priority levels
   - Complete analysis of 326 "muleteer" references across 24 files
   - 2 decisions confirmed via Q&A:
     • GitHub repository will be renamed
     • Archive files preserved as-is for historical accuracy

🌿 Branch **17-change-project-name-from-muleteer-to-escapement** created from main

🔗 **GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/fusupo/muleteer/issues/17

## Key Implementation Notes:
- **Critical changes**: Plugin manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) and skill invocation syntax (`/muleteer:*` → `/escapement:*`)
- **Repository URLs**: Will be updated to reflect GitHub repo rename (fusupo/muleteer → fusupo/escapement)
- **Archive files**: Skipping 230+ occurrences in `/docs/dev/cc-archive/` to preserve historical accuracy
- **Scope**: 11 active files to update (excluding archives)

🚀 Ready to begin work:
```bash
git checkout 17-change-project-name-from-muleteer-to-escapement
# Then start implementation
```

Or invoke: `/muleteer:work-session 17` to execute the scratchpad tasks with live TodoWrite tracking.

### 👤 User

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User invoked the skill `muleteer:issue-setup` with argument `17`, requesting initialization of work on GitHub issue #17.

2. **Skill Context Loading**: I received the skill definition for `issue-setup`, which provides a comprehensive workflow for transforming a GitHub issue into a development-ready environment.

3. **Phase 0 - Check Existing Context**: Following the skill workflow, I first checked for existing scratchpads to avoid duplicate work. Found none.

4. **Phase 1 - Gather Context (Parallel)**: I executed parallel operations:
   - Checked for existing scratchpads (none found)
   - Retrieved repository origin (https://github.com/fusupo/muleteer.git)
   - Got current branch (main)
   - Fetched GitHub issue #17 details - a request to rename the project from "muleteer" to "escapement"

5. **Phase 2 - Analyze & Plan**: I delegated to an Explore agent to thoroughly analyze the codebase for all "muleteer" references. The agent provided a comprehensive analysis finding 326 occurrences across 24 files, categorized by priority.

6. **Phase 3 - Create Scratchpad**: Created `SCRATCHPAD_17.md` with:
   - Issue details and description
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Implementation checklist broken into 5 priority levels
   - Technical notes about the renaming implications
   - Questions/clarifications section

7. **Phase 3.5 - Interactive Q&A**: I presented two clarification questions using AskUserQuestion:
   - Should GitHub repository be renamed? → User answered: "Yes, rename on GitHub"
   - How to handle archive files? → User answered: "Preserve as-is"

8. **Update Scratchpad with Decisions**: I updated the scratchpad with the user's decisions, marking the decisions made section and updating relevant task notes.

9. **Phase 4 - Prepare Workspace**: 
   - Checked for available base branches (found origin/main)
   - Created feature branch `17-change-project-name-from-muleteer-to-escapement` from origin/main
   - Confirmed branch creation

10. **Final Output**: Provided a summary of the setup completion with key details about the work ahead.

11. **Summary Request**: User requested a detailed summary of the conversation.

Key technical details:
- Issue #17 involves renaming "muleteer" to "escapement"
- 326 references across 24 files identified
- Priority-based implementation plan created
- Repository will be renamed on GitHub
- Archive files (230+ occurrences) will be preserved for historical accuracy
- Branch created: `17-change-project-name-from-muleteer-to-escapement`

No errors encountered during this workflow - everything executed successfully.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user requested to initialize work on GitHub issue #17 by invoking the `muleteer:issue-setup` skill with argument `17`. The issue itself requests renaming the project from "muleteer" to "escapement" because the original name feels "a bit insulting to the tool and the audience," while "escapement" provides "some other flatery to a sense of measure and control."

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - GitHub issue setup workflow with phased approach
   - Claude Code plugin architecture (v2.0)
   - Plugin manifest system (.claude-plugin/plugin.json)
   - Skill invocation namespace (plugin name determines skill prefix)
   - Task delegation to Explore subagent for codebase analysis
   - Interactive Q&A pattern using AskUserQuestion tool
   - Priority-based refactoring strategy
   - Git feature branch workflow
   - Breaking changes in plugin naming (affects skill invocation syntax)

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **SCRATCHPAD_17.md** (Created)
     - Why: Central planning document for issue implementation
     - Summary: Contains complete implementation plan with 15 tasks across 5 priority levels, acceptance criteria, technical notes, and user decisions
     - Key sections:
       ```markdown
       ## Acceptance Criteria
       - [ ] Plugin identifier changed from "muleteer" to "escapement"
       - [ ] All skill invocations updated from `/muleteer:*` to `/escapement:*`
       - [ ] Documentation updated to reference "Escapement" consistently
       - [ ] Plugin marketplace listing updated
       - [ ] Plugin works correctly with new name
       - [ ] No broken references or outdated "muleteer" mentions in active code/docs
       ```
     - Decisions recorded:
       ```markdown
       **Q: Should the GitHub repository itself be renamed from fusupo/muleteer to fusupo/escapement?**
       **A:** Yes, rename on GitHub
       **Rationale:** Full rename includes repository - all URL references will be updated

       **Q: How should historical archive files (230+ occurrences in /docs/dev/cc-archive/) be handled?**
       **A:** Preserve as-is
       **Rationale:** Archive files document actual historical development - maintain historical accuracy
       ```

   - **.claude-plugin/plugin.json** (Identified for modification)
     - Why: Core plugin identifier - changing `"name": "muleteer"` to `"name": "escapement"` is critical
     - Summary: Priority 1 change - affects skill invocation namespace

   - **.claude-plugin/marketplace.json** (Identified for modification)
     - Why: Marketplace listing identity
     - Summary: Priority 1 change - 3 references to plugin name need updating

   - **README.md** (Identified for modification)
     - Why: Primary user documentation with 18 occurrences of "muleteer"
     - Summary: Priority 1-2 changes including skill invocation examples (lines 44, 150, 151) and all descriptive text

   - **CLAUDE.md** (Identified for modification)
     - Why: Project instructions with 10 occurrences
     - Summary: Priority 1-2 changes including skill invocation syntax (lines 8, 44, 52, 166)

   - **skills/prime-session/SKILL.md** (Identified for modification)
     - Why: Example output showing project name
     - Summary: Priority 2 change - lines 259-260 show example output

   - **hooks/archive-session-log.sh** (Identified for modification)
     - Why: User-visible output message
     - Summary: Priority 3 change - line 153 comment text

   - **docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md, docs/WORKFLOW.md, docs/SESSION-ARCHIVING.md** (Identified for modification)
     - Why: Deprecated v1.0 documentation references
     - Summary: Priority 4 changes - `~/.muleteer/` path references (15 total occurrences)

   - **docs/dev/cc-archive/** (Identified but NOT modifying)
     - Why: Historical development records
     - Summary: 230+ occurrences - decision made to preserve as-is for historical accuracy

4. Errors and fixes:
   No errors encountered during this workflow. All operations executed successfully:
   - Scratchpad check completed
   - Git operations successful
   - GitHub API calls successful
   - Explore agent analysis completed
   - AskUserQuestion interactions worked correctly
   - File edits applied successfully
   - Branch creation successful

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Challenge**: Comprehensive identification of all "muleteer" references
     - **Solution**: Delegated to Explore subagent which systematically searched the codebase and found 326 occurrences across 24 files, categorized by priority and type
   
   - **Challenge**: Ambiguity about scope of rename (repository itself? archive files?)
     - **Solution**: Used AskUserQuestion tool to get explicit decisions on two key questions before proceeding
   
   - **Challenge**: Organizing a large refactoring task (326 references)
     - **Solution**: Created priority-based implementation plan (5 levels from Critical to Optional) with atomic, testable tasks

6. All user messages:
   - "init work on issue 17" - Initial request to set up work on GitHub issue #17
   - Summary request (current message) - Request for detailed conversation summary

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Execute the implementation plan in SCRATCHPAD_17.md (15 tasks across 5 priority levels)
   - Rename GitHub repository from fusupo/muleteer to fusupo/escapement
   - Test plugin functionality after rename
   - Create pull request with changes

8. Current Work:
   Immediately before this summary request, I had just completed the issue setup workflow for issue #17. Specifically, I:
   
   - Created the feature branch `17-change-project-name-from-muleteer-to-escapement` from origin/main
   - Confirmed branch creation successfully
   - Presented the final setup summary to the user:
     ```
     ✓ Issue #17 analyzed and prepared
     
     📋 SCRATCHPAD_17.md created with:
        - 15 implementation tasks across 5 priority levels
        - Complete analysis of 326 "muleteer" references across 24 files
        - 2 decisions confirmed via Q&A
     
     🌿 Branch 17-change-project-name-from-muleteer-to-escapement created from main
     
     🔗 GitHub Issue: https://github.com/fusupo/muleteer/issues/17
     ```
   
   The issue-setup skill workflow was fully completed. The workspace is now prepared with a detailed scratchpad and feature branch ready for implementation.

9. Optional Next Step:
   The issue setup task is complete. The user has not requested to proceed with implementation yet. Based on the final output I provided, the logical next step would be to:
   
   **Begin implementation** by either:
   - Manually checking out the branch: `git checkout 17-change-project-name-from-muleteer-to-escapement`
   - Or invoking the work-session skill: `/muleteer:work-session 17`
   
   However, I should wait for explicit user direction before proceeding, as the setup phase is concluded. The user may want to review the scratchpad first, or they may have other priorities.
   
   Direct quote from my final output showing where we left off:
   > "🚀 Ready to begin work:
   > ```bash
   > git checkout 17-change-project-name-from-muleteer-to-escapement
   > # Then start implementation
   > ```
   >

Run issue-setup to initialize?\"\n         header: \"Setup Required\"\n         multiSelect: false\n         options:\n           - label: \"Yes, run issue-setup\"\n             description: \"Create scratchpad and branch for this issue\"\n           - label: \"No, create manually\"\n             description: \"I'll set up the scratchpad myself\"\n   ```\n\n   If user chooses \"Yes\":\n   ```\n   Skill: issue-setup\n   args: \"{issue_number}\"\n   ```\n\n   **STOP here** - issue-setup will create scratchpad and can chain to work-session after.\n\n3. **If scratchpad exists:**\n   - Proceed to Phase 1 (normal work flow)\n\n### Phase 1: Validate Setup\n\n1. **Load Scratchpad:**\n   - Scratchpad confirmed to exist from Phase 0\n   - Read full scratchpad content\n   - Parse implementation checklist\n   - Identify completed vs pending tasks\n\n2. **Verify Branch:**\n   - Check current branch matches expected feature branch\n   - If not, offer to switch:\n     ```\n     AskUserQuestion:\n       question: \"Switch to feature branch {branch-name}?\"\n       options:\n         - \"Yes, switch branches\"\n         - \"No, stay on current branch\"\n     ```\n\n4. **Resume Detection:**\n   - Check Work Log for previous session\n   - Identify last task in progress\n   - Offer to resume or start fresh\n\n### Phase 2: Initialize TodoWrite\n\nCreate TodoWrite items from scratchpad checklist:\n\n```\nTodoWrite:\n  todos:\n    - content: \"{Task 1 description}\"\n      status: \"completed\"  # if already done\n      activeForm: \"{Task 1 active description}\"\n    - content: \"{Task 2 description}\"\n      status: \"in_progress\"  # current task\n      activeForm: \"{Task 2 active description}\"\n    - content: \"{Task 3 description}\"\n      status: \"pending\"\n      activeForm: \"{Task 3 active description}\"\n    ...\n```\n\n**Sync Strategy:**\n- TodoWrite = Live UI progress (transient, session-based)\n- Scratchpad = Persistent record with notes (survives sessions)\n- Keep both in sync: when TodoWrite updates, update scratchpad checkboxes\n\n### Phase 3: Work Loop\n\nFor each unchecked item in the Implementation Checklist:\n\n#### 3.1 Start Task\n\n1. **Update TodoWrite:**\n   - Mark current task as `in_progress`\n   - All others remain `pending` or `completed`\n\n2. **Display Task:**\n   ```\n   📍 Working on: {task description}\n      Files: {affected files}\n      Why: {rationale}\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Scratchpad Work Log:**\n   ```markdown\n   ### {Date} - Session Start\n   - Starting: {task description}\n   ```\n\n#### 3.2 Implement Task\n\n**Before starting implementation, assess complexity:**\n\n**Complex Task Detection → EnterPlanMode:**\nIf the task involves:\n- Changes to more than 3-4 files\n- Multiple valid implementation approaches\n- New patterns or architectural decisions\n- Significant refactoring\n\nThen suggest entering plan mode:\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"This task appears complex ({reason}). Enter plan mode first?\"\n  header: \"Approach\"\n  options:\n    - \"Yes, plan first\"\n      description: \"Enter plan mode to design approach before implementing\"\n    - \"No, proceed directly\"\n      description: \"Start implementing without formal planning\"\n```\n\nIf user chooses to plan, use `EnterPlanMode` tool.\n\n**Delegate Complex Subtasks → Task Tool:**\nFor complex analysis or exploration during implementation:\n```\nTask:\n  subagent_type: Explore\n  prompt: \"Find all usages of {pattern} and how they integrate with {module}\"\n  description: \"Explore {area} for implementation\"\n```\n\n**Execute the actual work:**\n- Use LSP for code navigation (goToDefinition, findReferences, documentSymbol)\n- Create/modify files as needed\n- Run relevant commands\n- Test changes locally\n\n#### 3.3 Complete Task\n\n1. **Update TodoWrite:**\n   - Mark task as `completed`\n   - Move to next task\n\n2. **Update Scratchpad:**\n   - Check off completed item: `- [x] {task}`\n   - Add notes to Work Log:\n     ```markdown\n     - Completed: {task description}\n       - Notes: {any decisions or observations}\n     ```\n\n3. **Offer Commit:**\n   ```\n   AskUserQuestion:\n     question: \"Task complete. Ready to commit?\"\n     header: \"Commit\"\n     options:\n       - \"Yes, commit now\"\n         description: \"Invoke commit-changes skill for this task\"\n       - \"Continue to next task\"\n         description: \"Skip commit, keep working\"\n       - \"Review changes first\"\n         description: \"Show me what changed before committing\"\n   ```\n\n4. **If committing:** Invoke `commit-changes` skill\n   ```\n   Skill: commit-changes\n   ```\n\n5. **Progress Update:**\n   ```\n   ✓ {X} of {Y} tasks complete\n   ```\n\n#### 3.4 Handle Blockers\n\nIf blocked during a task:\n\n1. **Update Scratchpad:**\n   - Add to Questions/Blockers section\n   - Note what's blocking progress\n\n2. **Ask User:**\n   ```\n   AskUserQuestion:\n     question: \"Encountered blocker: {description}. How to proceed?\"\n     options:\n       - \"Help me resolve it\"\n       - \"Skip to next task\"\n       - \"Pause work session\"\n       - \"Add to blockers and continue\"\n   ```\n\n### Phase 4: Continuous Sync\n\nThroughout the session:\n\n1. **Push Reminders:**\n   - After every 2-3 commits, offer to push:\n     ```\n     📤 You have {N} unpushed commits. Push to remote?\n     ```\n\n2. **Progress Persistence:**\n   - Keep scratchpad updated with running notes\n   - Work Log captures decisions made\n   - Checklist reflects completion state\n\n3. **Interruption Handling:**\n   - If work is interrupted, save state:\n     - Note current task in Work Log\n     - Save any uncommitted progress notes\n     - Can resume later with same skill\n\n### Phase 5: Completion Check\n\nWhen all Implementation Tasks are complete:\n\n1. **Quality Checks:**\n   - Run through Quality Checks section of scratchpad\n   - Execute linters/tests as applicable\n   - Self-review for code quality\n\n2. **Verify Acceptance Criteria:**\n   - Review original acceptance criteria\n   - Confirm all are met\n\n3. **Update Scratchpad:**\n   ```markdown\n   ### {Date} - Session Complete\n   - All implementation tasks complete\n   - Quality checks: {passed/issues}\n   - Ready for PR: {yes/no}\n   ```\n\n4. **Final TodoWrite:**\n   - All tasks marked `completed`\n   - Clear visual confirmation of completion\n\n### Phase 6: Next Steps\n\nPresent options:\n\n```\n✅ All tasks complete!\n\nOptions:\n1. Create PR → Invoke create-pr skill\n2. Archive scratchpad → Invoke archive-work skill\n3. Continue in session → Keep working (add more tasks?)\n4. End session → Save state and exit\n\nSelect option:\n```\n\n## State Management\n\n### TodoWrite ↔ Scratchpad Sync\n\n| Action | TodoWrite | Scratchpad |\n|--------|-----------|------------|\n| Task starts | `in_progress` | Work Log entry |\n| Task completes | `completed` | Checkbox checked, Work Log note |\n| Task blocked | stays `in_progress` | Blockers section updated |\n| Session ends | cleared | Work Log \"session end\" |\n| Session resumes | rebuilt from scratchpad | Work Log \"session resume\" |\n\n### Progress Recovery\n\nIf Claude Code restarts mid-session:\n1. Re-read scratchpad\n2. Rebuild TodoWrite from checklist state\n3. Resume from last incomplete task\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Scratchpad Not Found\n```\n❌ No scratchpad found for issue #{number}\n\n   Would you like to:\n   1. Run issue-setup for this issue\n   2. Specify a different issue number\n   3. Create a new scratchpad manually\n```\n\n### Wrong Branch\n```\n⚠️ Expected branch: {expected}\n   Current branch: {current}\n\n   Would you like to switch branches?\n```\n\n### Uncommitted Changes from Previous Session\n```\n⚠️ Found uncommitted changes from previous work.\n\n   Options:\n   1. Commit these changes now\n   2. Stash and continue\n   3. Review changes first\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Invokes:**\n- `commit-changes` skill - After completing tasks\n- `create-pr` skill - When all tasks complete\n- `archive-work` skill - After PR created\n\n**Invoked by:**\n- User directly via natural language\n- After `issue-setup` skill completes\n\n**Reads from:**\n- Scratchpad - Implementation plan\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Conventions\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Keep TodoWrite in sync with scratchpad\n- Add notes to Work Log for decisions\n- Commit after each logical task\n- Update blockers promptly\n- Review progress periodically\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Skip TodoWrite updates\n- Let scratchpad get stale\n- Batch too many changes before committing\n- Ignore blockers\n- Leave session without saving state\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.1.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-31\n**Maintained By:** Muleteer\n**Changelog:**\n- v1.1.0: Added EnterPlanMode for complex tasks, Task delegation, LSP navigation\n- v1.0.0: Initial conversion from commands/start-work.md\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 17"

    "text": "Base directory for this skill: /home/marc/muleteer/skills/commit-changes\n\n# Commit Changes Skill\n\n## Purpose\n\nCreate well-structured git commits following conventional commits format with project-aware module emojis. This skill analyzes changes, crafts meaningful commit messages, and ensures commits are atomic and purposeful.\n\n## Natural Language Triggers\n\nThis skill activates when the user says things like:\n- \"Commit these changes\"\n- \"Create a commit\"\n- \"Commit this\"\n- \"Save my changes\"\n- \"Make a commit for this work\"\n- After completing a scratchpad task: \"Done with this task, commit it\"\n\n## Workflow Execution\n\n### Phase 1: Gather Context (Parallel)\n\nExecute these in parallel for efficiency:\n\n1. **Project Context:**\n   - Read project's `CLAUDE.md` for module emojis and conventions\n   - Identify current development phase/priorities\n\n2. **Git Context:**\n   - `git status` - See staged/unstaged changes\n   - `git diff --cached` - Review staged changes (if any)\n   - `git diff` - Review unstaged changes\n   - `git branch --show-current` - Current branch\n   - `git log --oneline -5` - Recent commits for style reference\n\n### Phase 2: Analyze Changes\n\n1. **Categorize Changes:**\n   - Which files are modified/added/deleted?\n   - Which module(s) are affected?\n   - What type of change is this? (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)\n\n2. **Staging Decision:**\n   - If nothing staged but changes exist: Determine what should be staged together\n   - Group logically related changes\n   - Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit\n   - If multiple logical changes exist, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which to commit first\n\n3. **Validate Commit-Worthiness:**\n   - Ensure changes represent one logical unit of work\n   - Check for debugging code, console.logs, temp files\n   - Verify no secrets or sensitive data included\n\n### Phase 3: Craft Commit Message\n\n**Format:**\n```\n{module emoji}{change type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n{optional body explaining what and why}\n```\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Module Emoji:** From project's CLAUDE.md\n   - Check `## Project Modules` section for project-specific emojis\n   - Default examples: 🌐 api, 🎨 frontend, 🗄️ database, 🔐 auth, 📚 docs\n   - Use the most specific module that applies\n\n2. **Change Type Emoji:**\n   - ✨ feat: New feature\n   - 🐛 fix: Bug fix\n   - 📝 docs: Documentation\n   - 💄 style: Formatting/style\n   - ♻️ refactor: Code refactoring\n   - ⚡️ perf: Performance improvements\n   - ✅ test: Tests\n   - 🔧 chore: Tooling, configuration\n   - 🚀 ci: CI/CD improvements\n   - 🔥 fix: Remove code or files\n   - 🎨 style: Improve structure/format\n   - 🚑️ fix: Critical hotfix\n   - 🎉 chore: Begin a project\n   - 🏗️ refactor: Architectural changes\n   - 🏷️ feat: Add or update types\n   - ⚰️ refactor: Remove dead code\n\n3. **Type:** Conventional commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci)\n\n4. **Scope:** Module name from CLAUDE.md (e.g., api, frontend, skills)\n\n5. **Description:**\n   - Imperative mood (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n   - No period at end\n   - Under 50 characters\n   - Focus on capability/value added\n\n6. **Body (optional):**\n   - Explain what and why, not how\n   - Context for the change\n   - Reference issue numbers if applicable\n\n### Phase 4: Confirm with User\n\nUse `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the commit:\n\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"Ready to commit with this message?\"\n  header: \"Commit\"\n  options:\n    - label: \"Yes, commit\"\n      description: \"Create the commit with this message\"\n    - label: \"Edit message\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the commit message\"\n    - label: \"Stage more files\"\n      description: \"I need to include additional files\"\n    - label: \"Cancel\"\n      description: \"Don't commit right now\"\n```\n\nDisplay the proposed commit message clearly before asking.\n\n### Phase 5: Execute Commit\n\n1. **Stage files** (if not already staged):\n   ```bash\n   git add <files>\n   ```\n\n2. **Create commit** using HEREDOC for proper formatting:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   {module emoji}{type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}\n\n   {body if present}\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Confirm success:**\n   ```bash\n   git log -1 --oneline\n   ```\n\n### Phase 6: Report Result\n\nDisplay:\n```\n✓ Committed: {short hash} {commit message first line}\n\n📊 Stats: {files changed}, {insertions}+, {deletions}-\n\n🌿 Branch: {branch-name}\n```\n\n## Smart Staging Logic\n\nWhen unstaged changes exist across multiple areas:\n\n1. **Single logical change:** Stage all related files automatically\n2. **Multiple logical changes:** Present options via `AskUserQuestion`:\n   ```\n   question: \"Multiple changes detected. Which to commit first?\"\n   options:\n     - \"Module A changes (3 files)\"\n     - \"Module B changes (2 files)\"\n     - \"All changes together\"\n     - \"Let me specify\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Mixed concerns:** Warn and suggest splitting:\n   - \"These changes span unrelated modules. Recommend separate commits.\"\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore committing, verify:\n- [ ] No `console.log` or debug statements (unless intentional)\n- [ ] No TODO comments that should be addressed first\n- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or sensitive data\n- [ ] Changes are complete (no half-finished work)\n- [ ] Commit message accurately describes changes\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Nothing to Commit\nIf no changes exist:\n```\nℹ️ No changes to commit.\n   Working tree is clean.\n```\n\n### Merge Conflicts\nIf conflicts exist:\n```\n⚠️ Cannot commit: merge conflicts present.\n   Resolve conflicts first, then commit.\n```\n\n### Detached HEAD\nIf in detached HEAD state:\n```\n⚠️ Warning: You're in detached HEAD state.\n   Consider creating a branch before committing.\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n**Called by:**\n- `work-session` skill - After completing each scratchpad task\n- User directly via natural language\n\n**Works with:**\n- Project CLAUDE.md - Module emojis and conventions\n- Scratchpad - Context for what was being worked on\n\n## Project-Specific Adaptations\n\nThe skill reads the project's CLAUDE.md to determine:\n- Module names and their emojis\n- Commit message conventions (if custom)\n- Scope naming patterns\n\n**Example from a project CLAUDE.md:**\n```markdown\n## Project Modules\n- **api** 🌐: REST API endpoints\n- **frontend** 🎨: React UI components\n- **database** 🗄️: Database layer\n```\n\nThis skill would then use 🌐 for api changes, 🎨 for frontend changes, etc.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Create atomic commits (one logical change)\n- Write meaningful commit messages\n- Reference issues when applicable\n- Stage related files together\n- Use project-specific module emojis\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Commit unrelated changes together\n- Use vague messages like \"updates\" or \"fixes\"\n- Include debugging code\n- Commit secrets or credentials\n- Skip the body when context is needed\n- Add Claude attribution to commit messages\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29\n**Maintained By:** Muleteer\n**Converted From:** commands/commit.md\n"

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User invoked `/muleteer:issue-setup 17` to initialize work on GitHub issue #17
2. **Issue Setup Execution**: I followed the issue-setup skill workflow:
   - Phase 0: Checked for existing scratchpad (none found)
   - Phase 1: Gathered context in parallel (git remote, current branch, fetched issue #17)
   - Phase 2: Delegated to Explore agent for comprehensive codebase analysis
   - Phase 3: Created SCRATCHPAD_17.md with detailed implementation plan
   - Phase 3.5: Interactive Q&A - resolved 2 clarifications via AskUserQuestion
   - Phase 4: Created feature branch `17-change-project-name-from-muleteer-to-escapement`
3. **Summary Request**: User requested detailed summary (first time)
4. **Work Session Start**: User said "work on issue #17" - invoked work-session skill
5. **Work Execution**: Systematically worked through all 20 tasks in scratchpad:
   - Switched to feature branch
   - Initialized TodoWrite with all tasks
   - Completed tasks 1-16 (all implementation work)
   - Updated plugin manifests, documentation, skills, hooks, agents
   - Verified JSON validity and performed self-review
6. **Commit Request**: User said "commit" - invoked commit-changes skill
7. **Current State**: In commit-changes skill, crafted commit message, got user approval, about to execute commit

**Technical Details**:
- Issue #17: Rename "muleteer" to "escapement"
- 326 occurrences identified across 24 files
- Priority-based implementation (5 levels)
- Archive files preserved for historical accuracy
- Repository will be renamed on GitHub

**Key Decisions**:
- GitHub repo rename: YES (fusupo/muleteer → fusupo/escapement)
- Archive files: PRESERVE as-is (230+ occurrences in docs/dev/cc-archive/)

**Files Modified** (16 total):
- Plugin manifests, all skills, hooks, docs, agents
- Changed plugin name, skill invocation syntax, URLs, project descriptions

**Current Task**: About to stage and commit all rename changes with message already approved by user.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User invoked skill `muleteer:issue-setup 17` to initialize development work on GitHub issue #17
   - **Issue Goal**: Rename the project from "muleteer" to "escapement" because the original name felt "a bit insulting to the tool and the audience" while "escapement" provides "some other flattery to a sense of measure and control"
   - **Work Execution**: User said "work on issue #17" to begin implementing the rename via work-session skill
   - **Commit**: User said "commit" to save all completed rename changes

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Claude Code plugin architecture (v2.0)
   - Plugin manifest system (.claude-plugin/plugin.json)
   - Skill invocation namespace (plugin name determines `/plugin-name:skill` syntax)
   - Breaking change: skill invocation changes from `/muleteer:*` to `/escapement:*`
   - Priority-based refactoring strategy (5 priority levels)
   - Git feature branch workflow
   - Conventional commits format with module emojis
   - TodoWrite for progress tracking
   - Issue setup workflow with interactive Q&A
   - Scratchpad-driven development

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **SCRATCHPAD_17.md** (Created)
     - Why: Central planning document for issue implementation
     - Contains complete implementation plan with 20 tasks across 5 priority levels, acceptance criteria, technical notes, and user decisions
     - Key decisions recorded:
       ```markdown
       **Q: Should the GitHub repository itself be renamed from fusupo/muleteer to fusupo/escapement?**
       **A:** Yes, rename on GitHub
       
       **Q: How should historical archive files (230+ occurrences in /docs/dev/cc-archive/) be handled?**
       **A:** Preserve as-is
       ```

   - **.claude-plugin/plugin.json** (Modified - Priority 1)
     - Why: Core plugin identifier - changing name affects skill invocation namespace
     - Changes:
       ```json
       {
         "name": "escapement",  // was "muleteer"
         "repository": "https://github.com/fusupo/escapement"  // was muleteer
       }
       ```

   - **.claude-plugin/marketplace.json** (Modified - Priority 1)
     - Why: Marketplace listing identity
     - Changes:
       ```json
       {
         "name": "fusupo-escapement",  // was "fusupo-muleteer"
         "metadata": {
           "description": "Escapement - AI-code workflow system"  // was "Muleteer"
         },
         "plugins": [{
           "name": "escapement",  // was "muleteer"
           "repository": "https://github.com/fusupo/escapement"
         }]
       }
       ```

   - **README.md** (Modified - Priority 1-2)
     - Why: Primary user documentation
     - Changes: 18 occurrences of "Muleteer" → "Escapement"
     - Skill invocation examples updated:
       ```bash
       /escapement:issue-setup
       /escapement:commit-changes
       /escapement:create-pr
       ```
     - Repository URLs: `https://github.com/fusupo/escapement.git`
     - Path references: `/path/to/escapement`

   - **CLAUDE.md** (Modified - Priority 1-2)
     - Why: Project instructions for Claude Code
     - Changes: 10 occurrences of "Muleteer" → "Escapement"
     - Skill invocation syntax:
       ```markdown
       Skills: Automated workflow modules invoked via natural language or `/escapement:skill-name`
       ```
     - Directory structure updated to `escapement/`

   - **skills/prime-session/SKILL.md** (Modified - Priority 2)
     - Why: Example output showing project name
     - Changes:
       ```markdown
       📍 Project: escapement
          Repository: fusupo/escapement
       ```

   - **hooks/archive-session-log.sh** (Modified - Priority 3)
     - Why: User-visible output message
     - Changes:
       ```bash
       echo "*Session log archived by Escapement PreCompact hook*"
       ```

   - **All skill files** (Modified - Priority 2)
     - Files: `skills/*/SKILL.md` (7 files total)
     - Why: Skill metadata consistency
     - Changes: `**Maintained By:** Escapement` (was "Muleteer")

   - **agents/scratchpad-planner.md** (Modified)
     - Why: Agent role definition
     - Changes:
       ```markdown
       You are a specialized planning assistant for the `issue-setup` workflow in Escapement.
       Follow Escapement's philosophy: each task should be one commit, independently reviewable.
       ```

   - **docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md, docs/WORKFLOW.md, docs/SESSION-ARCHIVING.md** (Modified - Priority 4)
     - Why: Deprecated v1.0 documentation consistency
     - Changes: `~/.muleteer/` → `~/.escapement/` (15 total occurrences)
     - All "Muleteer" project name references → "Escapement"

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **No significant errors encountered** - workflow executed cleanly
   - One minor tool call issue when using Edit with replace_all before reading file (docs/WORKFLOW.md) - fixed by reading file first

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Challenge**: Comprehensive identification of all "muleteer" references
     - **Solution**: Delegated to Explore subagent which systematically searched and found 326 occurrences across 24 files, categorized by priority
   
   - **Challenge**: Ambiguity about rename scope (repository? archive files?)
     - **Solution**: Used AskUserQuestion to get explicit decisions before proceeding
   
   - **Challenge**: Organizing large refactoring task (326 references)
     - **Solution**: Created priority-based implementation plan (5 levels: Critical → Optional) with atomic, testable tasks

6. All user messages:
   - "init work on issue 17" - Initial request to set up work on GitHub issue #17
   - First summary request (after issue setup completed)
   - "work on issue #17" - Request to begin implementation work
   - "commit" - Request to commit completed changes
   - Current summary request

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Execute the git commit (approved by user, ready to stage and commit)
   - After commit, testing tasks require user action:
     - Test plugin loads with new name
     - Test skill invocation with /escapement:* syntax
     - Verify README.md renders correctly
     - Verify CLAUDE.md is accurate for new name
   - Rename GitHub repository from fusupo/muleteer to fusupo/escapement
   - Create pull request with changes

8. Current Work:
   Immediately before this summary request, I was in the **commit-changes skill** execution, having just received user approval to commit. Specifically:
   
   - **Phase 4: Confirm with User** - Completed
     - Presented commit message via AskUserQuestion
     - User selected "Yes, commit"
   
   - **Proposed Commit Message** (user-approved):
     ```
     🔌♻️ refactor(identity): Rename project from muleteer to escapement

     Complete project rename addressing:
     - Plugin identifier and namespace (/muleteer:* → /escapement:*)
     - All documentation and user-facing content
     - Repository URLs (fusupo/muleteer → fusupo/escapement)
     - Skill metadata and examples
     - Hook output messages
     - Deprecated path references

     Resolves #17
     ```
   
   - **Files to be committed** (16 modified files):
     - .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
     - .claude-plugin/plugin.json
     - CLAUDE.md
     - README.md
     - agents/scratchpad-planner.md
     - docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md
     - docs/SESSION-ARCHIVING.md
     - docs/WORKFLOW.md
     - hooks/archive-session-log.sh
     - skills/archive-work/SKILL.md
     - skills/commit-changes/SKILL.md
     - skills/create-pr/SKILL.md
     - skills/issue-setup/SKILL.md
     - skills/prime-session/SKILL.md
     - skills/review-pr/SKILL.md
     - skills/work-session/SKILL.md
   
   - **Current branch**: `17-change-project-name-from-muleteer-to-escapement`
   
   - **Next action in workflow**: Phase 5 (Execute Commit) - stage all modified files and create commit

9. Optional Next Step:
   Execute the git commit as this is the direct continuation of the commit-changes skill workflow that was interrupted by the summary request. The user has already approved the commit message with "Yes, commit".
   
   Direct quote from conversation showing where I left off:
   > User: "commit"
   > Assistant: [Invoked commit-changes skill, gathered context, crafted message, presented to user]
   > User: [Selected "Yes, commit" option]
   > [Summary request interrupted execution]
   
   The next step is to execute Phase 5 of the commit-changes skill:
   1. Stage all 16 modified files: `git add .claude-plugin/marketplace.json .claude-plugin/plugin.json CLAUDE.md README.md agents/scratchpad-planner.md docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md docs/SESSION-ARCHIVING.md docs/WORKFLOW.md hooks/archive-session-log.sh skills/archive-work/SKILL.md skills/commit-changes/SKILL.md skills/create-pr/SKILL.md skills/issue-setup/SKILL.md skills/prime-session/SKILL.md skills/review-pr/SKILL.md skills/work-session/SKILL.md`
   2. Create commit with approved message using HEREDOC format
   3. Display commit confirmation with hash, stats, and branch info.
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

## ✅ All Implementation Tasks Complete!

All code changes for the project rename have been completed and committed. The remaining tasks require user action to verify the changes work correctly.

### Remaining Quality Checks (User Action Required):

1. **Test plugin loads:** `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/escapement`
2. **Test skill invocation:** Try `/escapement:issue-setup`, `/escapement:commit-changes`, etc.
3. **Verify documentation:** Check README.md and CLAUDE.md render correctly on GitHub
4. **Rename GitHub repository:** fusupo/muleteer → fusupo/escapement (GitHub settings)

### Next Steps - Choose One:

1. **Push changes** → Push the branch to GitHub for backup
2. **Create PR** → Open pull request for review (after GitHub repo renamed)
3. **Test locally first** → Verify plugin works with new name before pushing
4. **Rename GitHub repo** → Update repository name in GitHub settings, then create PR

    "text": "Base directory for this skill: /home/marc/muleteer/skills/create-pr\n\n# Create PR Skill\n\n## Purpose\n\nCreate well-structured pull requests that link to originating issues, summarize changes clearly, and facilitate effective code review. This skill analyzes the branch, detects related issues, and generates comprehensive PR descriptions.\n\n## Natural Language Triggers\n\nThis skill activates when the user says things like:\n- \"Create a PR\"\n- \"Open a pull request\"\n- \"Make a PR for this work\"\n- \"Submit this for review\"\n- \"I'm ready to create a pull request\"\n- \"PR this branch\"\n- After work completion: \"Done, let's open a PR\"\n\n## Workflow Execution\n\n### Phase 1: Gather Context (Parallel)\n\nExecute these in parallel for efficiency:\n\n1. **Project Context:**\n   - Read project's `CLAUDE.md` for PR conventions\n   - Identify target branch (main, develop, etc.)\n\n2. **Branch Analysis:**\n   - `git branch --show-current` - Current branch name\n   - `git log main..HEAD --oneline` - Commits on this branch\n   - `git diff main...HEAD --stat` - Change summary\n\n3. **Remote Status:**\n   - Check if branch is pushed to remote\n   - Check if remote is up to date\n\n### Phase 2: Detect Issue Context\n\n1. **Extract Issue Reference from Branch Name:**\n\n   Common patterns:\n   - `42-feature-description` → Issue #42\n   - `feature/42-description` → Issue #42\n   - `fix/123-bug-name` → Issue #123\n   - `ABC-123-description` → Linear issue ABC-123\n\n2. **Retrieve Issue Details:**\n\n   **For GitHub Issues:**\n   ```\n   mcp__github__get_issue(owner, repo, issue_number)\n   ```\n   - Get title, description, acceptance criteria\n   - Get labels for PR labeling\n   - Check issue state (should be open)\n\n   **For Linear Issues:**\n   ```\n   mcp__linear__get_issue(id)\n   ```\n   - Get issue details and context\n\n3. **Build Context Map:**\n   - Original issue requirements\n   - Acceptance criteria to verify\n   - Related issues (blocks, depends on)\n   - Milestone/project context\n\n### Phase 3: Analyze Changes\n\n1. **Commit Analysis:**\n   - Review each commit message\n   - Identify modules affected\n   - Categorize change types (feat, fix, etc.)\n\n2. **Change Summary:**\n   - Files changed and why\n   - Key functionality added/modified\n   - Breaking changes (if any)\n\n3. **Verify Completeness:**\n   - Do commits address the issue requirements?\n   - Are acceptance criteria met?\n   - Any outstanding work?\n\n### Phase 4: Generate PR Content\n\n**PR Title:**\nFormat: `{type}: {description} (#{issue_number})`\n\nExample: `feat: Add commit-changes skill (#42)`\n\n**PR Description Template:**\n```markdown\n## Summary\n{Brief explanation aligned with original issue goals}\n\n## Issue Resolution\nCloses #{issue_number}\n\n{How this implementation addresses the original requirements}\n\n## Key Changes\n- {Module-focused change descriptions}\n- {New capabilities enabled}\n- {Breaking changes if any}\n\n## Implementation Notes\n{Any deviations from issue description}\n{Technical decisions made}\n{Trade-offs considered}\n\n## Testing\n{How this was tested}\n{What testing is appropriate for current project phase}\n\n## Checklist\n- [ ] Code follows project conventions\n- [ ] Changes are atomic and reviewable\n- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)\n- [ ] Tests added/updated (if applicable)\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Confirm with User\n\nUse `AskUserQuestion` to confirm PR details:\n\n```\nAskUserQuestion:\n  question: \"Ready to create this PR?\"\n  header: \"Create PR\"\n  options:\n    - label: \"Yes, create PR\"\n      description: \"Create the PR with this title and description\"\n    - label: \"Edit title\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the PR title\"\n    - label: \"Edit description\"\n      description: \"I want to modify the PR description\"\n    - label: \"Create as draft\"\n      description: \"Create as draft PR (not ready for review)\"\n    - label: \"Cancel\"\n      description: \"Don't create PR right now\"\n```\n\nDisplay the proposed title and description before asking.\n\n### Phase 6: Create Pull Request\n\n1. **Ensure branch is pushed:**\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin {branch-name}\n   ```\n\n2. **Create PR using gh CLI:**\n   ```bash\n   gh pr create \\\n     --title \"{title}\" \\\n     --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   {PR description}\n   EOF\n   )\" \\\n     --base {target-branch}\n   ```\n\n   Or use MCP GitHub tools:\n   ```\n   mcp__github__create_pull_request(...)\n   ```\n\n3. **Apply labels** (from issue + modules affected)\n\n4. **Link to issue** (auto-close on merge via \"Closes #X\")\n\n### Phase 7: Report Result\n\nDisplay:\n```\n✓ Pull Request created!\n\n🔗 PR #XX: {title}\n   {PR URL}\n\n📋 Linked to Issue #{issue_number}\n\n👀 Ready for review\n   Target: {target-branch}\n   Reviewers: {if any suggested}\n```\n\n## Auto-Configuration\n\nBased on context, automatically determine:\n\n1. **Target Branch:**\n   -

Perfect! I have all the context. Let me generate the PR content.

**Proposed PR Title:**
```
refactor: Rename project from muleteer to escapement (#17)
```

**Proposed PR Description:**
```markdown
## Summary

Complete project rename from "muleteer" to "escapement" to better align with the project's purpose and audience. The new name "escapement" conveys a sense of measure and control, fitting the workflow system's goal of providing structured development processes.

## Issue Resolution

Closes #17

This PR implements a comprehensive rename across all project files:
- Plugin identity and namespace
- All documentation and user-facing content  
- Repository URL references
- Skill metadata and examples
- Hook output messages

## Key Changes

### Breaking Changes ⚠️
- **Skill invocation namespace**: `/muleteer:*` → `/escapement:*`
- **Plugin name**: `muleteer` → `escapement`
- **Repository URLs**: `fusupo/muleteer` → `fusupo/escapement`

### Files Modified (16 total)
- **🔌 Plugin manifests**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- **📚 Core docs**: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **🎯 All skills**: Updated "Maintained By" metadata (7 files)
- **🪝 Hooks**: Updated output message in `archive-session-log.sh`
- **📖 Extended docs**: `CUSTOMIZATION.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `SESSION-ARCHIVING.md`
- **🤖 Agents**: `scratchpad-planner.md`

### Preserved
- **Archive files**: 230+ historical references in `docs/dev/cc-archive/` preserved as-is for accuracy

## Implementation Notes

**Scope**: 326 occurrences of "muleteer" identified across 24 files
**Strategy**: Priority-based implementation (Critical → Optional)
**Archive decision**: Historical session logs and scratchpads preserved unchanged

## Next Steps (Post-Merge)

1. **Rename GitHub repository**: `fusupo/muleteer` → `fusupo/escapement` (Settings → Rename)
2. **Test plugin loading**: `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/escapement`
3. **Verify skill invocation**: `/escapement:issue-setup`, `/escapement:commit-changes`, etc.
4. **Update local remotes**: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/fusupo/escapement.git`

## Testing

- ✅ All JSON files validated (plugin.json, marketplace.json)
- ✅ Documentation reviewed for broken references
- ✅ Self-review completed for missed occurrences
- ⏳ Plugin loading test (requires user action post-merge)
- ⏳ Skill invocation test (requires user action post-merge)

## Checklist

- [x] Code follows project conventions
- [x] Changes are atomic and reviewable
- [x] Documentation updated comprehensively
- [x] Breaking changes documented clearly
- [x] Historical archives preserved accurately

Perfect! ✓ PR #18 merged successfully to main.

## Remaining Tasks:

### 1. Archive Scratchpad (Ready Now)
Would you like me to archive `SCRATCHPAD_17.md` now that the work is complete?

### 2. Rename GitHub Repository (Manual Step)
You'll need to:
- Go to https://github.com/fusupo/muleteer/settings
- Scroll to "Repository name"
- Change `muleteer` to `escapement`
- Click "Rename"
- GitHub will handle redirects automatically

### 3. Update Local Remote (After Rename)
Once the repo is renamed:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/fusupo/escapement.git
```

### 4. Test Plugin (After Rename)
```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/escapement
/escapement:issue-setup
```

---

Would you like me to **archive the scratchpad** now, or would you prefer to rename the repository first?
